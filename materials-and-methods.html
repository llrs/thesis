<!--# COPIED!!! from article https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246367#sec005 -->
<p>Samples from the HSCT dataset used in this thesis were from a cohort of patients with severe refractory CD undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Patients were treated in the Department of Gastroenterology (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona –Spain–).
The protocol was approved by the Catalan Transplantation Organization and by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona (Study Number HCB/2012/7244).
All patients provided written consent following extensive counselling.
Colonic and ileal biopsies were obtained at several time points during ileo-colonoscopy.
Patients were followed-up for 4 years and biopsies were collected every six or twelve months after HSCT.
Samples were obtained whenever possible from both uninvolved and involved areas.
In addition, biopsies were taken from the ileum and colon regions of 19 non-IBD controls consisting of individuals with no history of IBD and who presented no significant pathological findings following endoscopic examination for colon cancer surveillance (Hospital Univesitari Mútua de Terrassa–Spain–).
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Hospital Univesitari Mútua de Terrassa (Study Number NA1651).
At least one biopsy was collected and fresh-frozen at -80°C for microbial DNA extraction.
The remaining biopsies were placed in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen, Hilde, Germany) and stored at -80°C until total RNA extraction.</p>

<!--# Adapted from the ethical committee submission-->
<p>All patients with an established diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, IBD unclassified, indeterminate colitis, or pouchitis, starting treatment with a biologic agent were monitored following the schedule of clinical visits, laboratory tests, imaging procedures and biologic sampling at the beginning of their treatment with anti-TNF therapy and after 14 weeks and 46 weeks a biopsy from an ileocolonoscopy.
Patients that were referred to the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona IBD unit, who had already started treatment with a biologic agent in another center, were also included adapting to the corresponding time-schedule of their treatment.
In all patients, starting anti-TNF treatment will be decided before the protocol entry decision according to medical clinical practice.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona (Study Number HCB/2012/7845 and HCB/2012/7956).</p>

<p>Biopsies from the HSCT CD cohort were resuspended in 180 μl TET (TrisHCl 0.02M, EDTA 0.002M, Triton 1X) buffer and 20mg/ml lysozyme (Carl Roth, Quimivita, S.A.). Samples were incubated for 1h at 37°C and vortexed with 25 μl Proteinase K before incubating at 56°C for 3h.
Buffer B3 (NucleoSpin Tissue Kit–Macherey-Nagel) was added followed by a heat treatment for 10 min at 70°C.
After adding 100% ethanol, samples were centrifuged at 11000 x g for 1 min.
Two washing steps were performed before eluting DNA.
Concentrations and purity were checked using NanoDrop One (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Samples were immediately used or placed at -20°C for long-term storage.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> DNA sequencing</h3>
<p>Library preparation and sequencing were performed at the Technische Universität München.
Briefly, volumes of 600μL DNA stabilization solution (STRATEC biomedical) and 400μL Phenol:choloform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the aliquots.
Microbial cells were disrupted by mechanical lysis using FastPrep-24.
Heat treatment and centrifugation were conducted after adding a cooling adaptor.
Supernatants were treated with RNase to eliminate RNA.
Total DNA was purified using gDNA columns as described in detail previously <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-berry2011" role="doc-biblioref">182</a>]</span>.
Briefly, the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene were amplified (15x15 cycles) following a previously described two-step protocol <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-klindworth2013" role="doc-biblioref">183</a>]</span> using forward and reverse primers 341F-ovh/785R-ovh <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-edgar2013a" role="doc-biblioref">184</a>]</span>.
Purification of amplicons was performed by using the AMPure XP system (Beckmann).
Next, sequencing was performed with pooled samples in paired-end modus (PE275) using an MiSeq system (Illumina, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 25% (v/v) PhiX standard library.</p>
<!--# Macrogen: 341f/785r not used/contaminated --->
<p>On the BARCELONA dataset the data was processed using 16S-V3V4 primers pair 341f/806r on a MiSeq Nano sequencing bcl2fastq (v1.8.4).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Microbial profiling</h3>
<p>For the HSCT dataset the processing of raw-reads was performed by using the <a href="https://www.imngs.org/" title="IMNGS website">IMNGS</a> (version 1.0 Build 2007) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-lagkouvardos2016" role="doc-biblioref">185</a>]</span> pipeline based on the <a href="https://www.drive5.com/uparse/" title="UPARSE website">UPARSE</a> approach <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-edgar2013a" role="doc-biblioref">184</a>]</span>.
Sequences were demultiplexed, trimmed to the first base with a quality score &lt;3 and then paired.
Sequences with less than 300 and more than 600 nucleotides and paired reads with an expected error &gt;3 were excluded from the analysis.
The 5 nucleotides from each end of the remaining reads were trimmed to avoid GC bias and non-random base composition .
Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered at 97% sequence similarity.
Taxonomy assignment was performed at 80% confidence level using the RDP classifier and the SILVA ribosomal RNA gene database project.
Later the data was normalized using the same method as for RNA-seq described above.
The microbiome was visually inspected for batch effects in PCA; none were found.
The resulting OTUs table was normalized using edgeR (Version 3.28) <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-mccarthy2012" role="doc-biblioref">112</a>]</span>.</p>

It creates amplicon sequencing variants from the 16S sequencing data, without merging similar sequences at any threshold.
It is an alternative to OTUs which allows to be able to compare results between studies because it doesn’t summarize together any sequence and provides more resolution to differences on the fragment amplified.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Statistics</h2>
<p>Comparisons between different conditions of samples of the datasets were calculated following the limma-voom method <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-ritchie2015" role="doc-biblioref">187</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-law2014" role="doc-biblioref">188</a>]</span> after being transformed via the edgeR package <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-mccarthy2012" role="doc-biblioref">112</a>]</span> following the workflow described on <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-law2018" role="doc-biblioref">189</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>A false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing was performed when necessary following the method of Benjamini and Hochberg <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-yoavbenjamini" role="doc-biblioref">190</a>]</span>.
FDR values below an alpha level 0.05 were considered significant.
If there weren’t multiple comparisons the alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine if a test was significant.</p>
<p>Besides correcting for multiple testing, several different methods were used on this thesis which will be described below.
Functional enrichment related tests/methods stand out from the other methods used.</p>
<div id="functional-enrichment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Functional enrichment</h3>
<p>Functional enrichment methods are those methods that aim to provide with more information about the variables besides their numerical value measured.
They can be very different in nature but they all use the numeric values of the variables and other information, being it from the same experiment data collection or from external data sources.
Most of them are based on an over representation analysis (ORA), where a group of elements is tested whether they are present on other group.
This can be done with <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/clusterProfiler">clusterProfiler</a> which tests genes enrichment for functionality based on information on pathway databases <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-wu2021" role="doc-biblioref">191</a>]</span>.
It checks the enrichment of features of a given group on the (background) list provided.
The test used is usually the fisher test, the hypergeometric test or the proportion test.</p>
<!--# cfr from Maria Vila thesis-->
<p>There are other methods that to test if some variables shows an unexpected importance according to a statistic like fold change or value gene set enrichment analysis was developed <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-subramanian2005" role="doc-biblioref">192</a>]</span> .
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method originally developed to determine whether a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant and concordant differences between two biological states.
These methods check if a group of variables present in an ordered list is present in some skewed distribution and compare it against a random group of similar size or with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.</p>
<p>For testing gene set enrichment analysis I used <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea">fgsea</a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-korotkevich2021" role="doc-biblioref">193</a>]</span> implementation for its speed and integration with other methods used on this thesis.
Pathways of genes from the REACTOME database were tested on the weight of different models or on the comparisons performed <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-fabregat2016" role="doc-biblioref">194</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>To estimate the expression of the pathways and compare their expression levels between conditions gene set variation analsyis as implemented on <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/GSVA">GSVA</a> was used <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-hänzelmann2013" role="doc-biblioref">195</a>]</span>.
It is a method that summarize the variables’ numerical value changing the space of <span class="math inline">\(variable\text{ x }sample\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(group\text{ x }sample\)</span> .
This enables other methods to use this new space instead of the original variables.
GSVA was used (again from the REACTOME database) and try to find the relationships between the pathways and the microbiome at different taxonomic levels.</p>

<div id="other-methods-used" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Other methods used</h3>
<p>The adonis method, provided by the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegan">vegan</a> package, was used to test if microbiome data variance is due to other variables <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-oksanen2020" role="doc-biblioref">196</a>]</span>.
This allows to test if the variables are related to the variance of the data.
This is particularly important on the microbiome data, which is highly variable.
It was used to detect which variables were important to include in the models of the disease.</p>
<p>I tested which variables, (sex, age, location, time since diagnostic) are important on the datasets with <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/globaltest">globaltest</a>.
It is a package with methods for testing complex hypothesis and help decide if the variables were influencing <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-goeman2006" role="doc-biblioref">197</a>]</span>.
It provides a general test statistic to test a hypothesis against a high dimensional dataset.</p>
<p>Microbiome diversity was measured using vegan and <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/phyloseq">phyloseq</a> methods <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-oksanen2020" role="doc-biblioref">196</a>]</span>.
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-diversity is a measure of how much a given microbiome at a taxonomic level is present on a sample.
Several measures exists, on the thesis I used the effective Simpson or Shannon diversity index to compare diversity between samples and conditions.
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-diversity was calculated using the phyloseq package for exploratory analysis.</p>
<p>We wanted to see if using some co-expression measure between the microbiome and the RNAseq would help identify relationships.
We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis as implemented on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=WGCNA">WGCNA</a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-langfelder2008" role="doc-biblioref">198</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>To find relationships between microorganisms and genes multiple co-inertia analysis, also known as MCIA, was used.
It is a method to examine covariant gene expression patterns between two blocks <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-meng2014" role="doc-biblioref">199</a>]</span> provided by the package <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/omicade4">omicade4</a>.
It was used as a baseline method to compare the RGCCA integration.</p>
<p>To explore how much do different blocks of a dataset have in common <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/STATegRa">STATegRa</a> was used <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-planell2021" role="doc-biblioref">200</a>]</span>.
It is a framework for integrating datasets with two data types using parametric and non-parametric methods.</p>
<p>When evaluating a model using bootstrap, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=BaseSet">BaseSet</a> was developed and used to find which variables were really involved on the interaction and how likely were to be together.
It is a package that uses fuzzy set logic for easy calculation of probability to belong to a group.
It can be used to calculate the size of the sets given a probability of having each element on the sets.</p>
<p>To avoid batch effect on the sequencing of the BARCELONA dataset <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=experDesign">experDesign</a> was developed and used <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-revillasancho2021" role="doc-biblioref">201</a>]</span>.
It helps to quantify if a given experiment has batch effect due to the batches used to measure the values.</p>
<p>The main method used on this thesis has been regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) as implemented on the homonymous package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=RGCCA">RGCCA</a> <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-tenenhaus2017a" role="doc-biblioref">202</a>]</span>.
It will be explained in detail on the next section.</p>
<p>To estimate if the selected features (genes or microorganism) by RGCCA have some biological meaningful contribution I measured if they can classify features using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=pROC">pROC</a> package, such as, which gastrointestinal segment are each sample from, or which type of disease does each patient have <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-robin2011" role="doc-biblioref">203</a>]</span>.
The area under the curve (AUC) of specificity and sensitivity measurements, also known as receiver operating characteristic ROC, was compared between several values accounting for different genes and microorganisms.</p>

<div id="regularized-generalized-canonical-correlation-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis</h2>
<p>The canonical correlation is a method that uses data from the same sample but from different datasets.
The regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis is an extension to the canonical correlation analysis <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-jordan1875" role="doc-biblioref">204</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-hotelling1936" role="doc-biblioref">205</a>]</span> which includes a regularization step to select which are the variables more relevant.</p>
<div id="description" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Description</h3>
<p>Over several years of progress on the field of canonical correlations <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-tenenhaus_regularized_2011" role="doc-biblioref">82</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-tenenhaus_variable_2014" role="doc-biblioref">83</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-tenenhaus_component-based_2008" role="doc-biblioref">206</a>–<a href="references.html#ref-gloaguen2020" role="doc-biblioref">210</a>]</span> RGCCA is a robust method with a fast and usable implementation <span class="citation">[<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="R-RGCCA"><strong>???</strong></span>]</span>.</p>
<p>The required data is a numeric matrix, as big as you want, as it is designed for datasets with more variables than samples ( <span class="math inline">\(p \gg n\)</span>).
It needs to have a complete case with no missing values (at the time of writing this thesis there is a new development version not released on CRAN<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> yet that replaces any missing value by a 0) and time is not considered as a special variable.
Data should be from the same samples and it is not specific to a certain technology or method used to obtain the data.</p>
<p>It uses a dimensional reduction approach to relate the different data sets between them and produce specific factors for each dataset.
The interpretation of the RGCCA results is complex and require expertise and familiarity with the technique used and is highly dependent on the model and options used.</p>
<p>To perform the dimensional reduction using the sparse method it looks to maximize this function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\underset{a_1,a_2, \ldots,a_J}{\text{maximize}} \sum_{j, k = 1}^J c_{jk}g(\mathrm{cov}(X_j a_j, X_k a_k)) \mathrm{~~s.t.~~} \Vert a_j \Vert_2 = 1 \text{ and } \Vert a_j \Vert_1 \le s_j, j=1,\ldots,J
\]</span></p>
<p>Being <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> the values for sample <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, the weights of the variables of said sample are represented by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.
While <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a function that can take the form of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, also known as Horst method, <span class="math inline">\(\Vert x \Vert\)</span> known as centroid method, <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> known as factorial method, or any user-supplied function.
The smaller the <span class="math inline">\(s_j\)</span>, the larger the degree of sparsity for <span class="math inline">\(a_j\)</span>.
As <span class="math inline">\(s_j\)</span> is closer to 0, more features are selected as it looks to optimize covariance, while if it is closer to 1 less features are selected and it resembles the correlation.
The values of <span class="math inline">\(s_j\)</span> were estimated using <span class="citation">[<a href="references.html#ref-schäfer2005" role="doc-biblioref">211</a>]</span> when the block was from 16S data or RNaseq, otherwise 1 was used and always using the centroid method.</p>
<!--# TODO: regularization going on here? -->
<p>To measure the quality of the model, the implementation provides indicators based on the Average Variance Explained (AVE): it returns an AVE score for each block, an AVE score which measures how each variable correlates with their block component, an AVE score of the inner model, which measures how each dimension accounts for the variance.
The higher the score is to 1 the better does it work.</p>
<p>To model what might be the relationships between the datasets current practices include using a pre-selected model of relations between blocks.
However, this model might not be accurate and several models might need to be fitted.
To help find the fitting model for the data I created an R package, named <a href="https://llrs.github.io/inteRmodel/">inteRmodel</a>, which helps finding the right model and measure how fit it is for your data via a bootstrapping procedure and the provided AVE scores.</p>
<p>This method was applied to the previously described datasets to find the relationship between microorganisms and the disease.</p>
</div>
<div id="relationships-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Relationships’ models</h3>
<p>There is no formal definition of what constitutes a block of data on multi-omics tools.
Most multi-omics and integration tools assume one block for each type of data, such as an essay a survey or an experiment.
We decided to split the block with data about the samples to separate independent variables from the same block.
The hypothesis we made was that more blocks with highly related variables but independent from the other blocks would fit better the data and thus help to identify causal or dependent variables.</p>
<p>To provide a ground truth, a model with only the relationships between the two experimental obtained data is analyzed, on what it is called the model 0.
The next model analyzed consists on the relationships between the two experimental blocks and them with the metadata of the samples, that is model 1.
All models that have one block with metadata are from the same family of models 1.</p>
<p>Later instead of a big metadata block, following our theory we split this metadata block on several ones, we have a block for time related variables, another one for location and the other about the people on the study.
This allows to design a model with an expected relationships between these dimensions and help make more interpretable the relationships.
These models are from the family 2.</p>
<p>For each family of models we tested all possible models to find the best model on each datasets.
However, the dimension reduction methods, as well as, generalized canonical correlation analysis, can’t identify causal relationships.
Furthermore, there is no test to decide if a variable selected has some meaningful biological value.</p>
<p>Models were further validated using a bootstrap approach to measure their accuracy and likelihood on the data available.</p>
