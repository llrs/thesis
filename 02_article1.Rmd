# RGCCA

The canonical correlation is a method that using data from the same sample but from different datasets.
Characteristics Input Data type: numeric More variables than samples: It is appropriate when the number of variables is higher than the number of samples.
Need to be a complete case.
Time is not considered as a specially variable Relationship between variables

Output:

Specific factors Interpretation:

Depending on the model and options used.

Over several years of progress [@tenenhaus_component-based_2008; @esposito_vinzi_bridge_2010; @tenenhaus_regularized_2011; @tenenhaus_regularized_2014; @tenenhaus_variable_2014; @tenenhaus_kernel_2015] on the field of canonical correlations it provides a robust method and there is an implementation [@R-RGCCA].

## This requires a model of relationships.

More blocks more possible models

Limitations: symmetric Y -\> X & X -\> Y

## Designing models

What defines a block: Blocks of variables are treated independently

Considering disease

Randomly

## Evaluating models

AVE, inner and outer

Bootstraping/validation on an external cohort.

Biological relevance
