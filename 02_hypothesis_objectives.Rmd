# Hypothesis and objectives

## Hypothesis

I hypothesize that the presence of certain microorganisms are related to the patient well being.
Furthermore, the expression state of the epithelium and the amount of bacterial presence might identify whether patients are suffering an inflammatory bowel disease.
Finally, I believe that environmental factors interact with the inflammatory bowel disease and are responsible of the big variability on the inflammatory bowel disease discourse.

## Objectives

Identify microorganisms and genes related to the inflammatory bowel disease.

-   Genes and microorganisms that are related to healthy patients

-   Genes and microorganisms that are related to inflammatory bowel disease patients while controlling for environmental factors.

    -   Only related to Crohn's disease

    -   Only related to ulcerative colitis

    -   Related to both

-   Effect of the genes and microorganisms related to the inflammatory bowel disease.
