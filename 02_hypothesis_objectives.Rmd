# Hypothesis and objectives

## Hypothesis

<!--# TODO add paragraphs to summarize the introduction -->
IBD is a gastrointestinal disease affecting preferentially the lower intestinal tract causing lesions on the epithelium. 
Bacteria interact with host's epithelium and with many other variables.
There are data integration methods for a variety of purposes, including finding relationships between variables. 
On IBD these methods have not been used much to find which bacteria is related to the host's genes. 

We hypothesize that the expression state of the epithelium and the **microorganisms present might identify whether patients are suffering IBD if environmental factors are taken into account**.

## Objectives

The main objective of this thesis is finding the relationships between microbiome and gene expression in the intestinal mucosa. For this reason we identify microorganisms and genes related to IBD.

-   Identify relationships between intestinal mucosal gene expression and microbiome presence on the intestine. 

-   Determine the influence in the microbiota and mucosa relationship of clinical variables such as location (colon and ileum), disease status, sex, age, treatment received, etc. in the microbiome and mucosa relationship.

-   Identify groups of possible underlying mechanism interactions between the microbiome and mucosa in IBD.
