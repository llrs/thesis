# Hypothesis and objectives

## Hypothesis

I hypothesize that the presence of certain microorganisms are related to the patient well being.
Furthermore, the expression state of the epithelium and the amount of bacterial presence might identify whether patients are suffering an IBD.
Finally, I believe that environmental factors interact with the IBD and are responsible of the big variability on the IBD discourse.

## Objectives

Identify microorganisms and genes related to the IBD.

-   Genes and microorganisms that are related to healthy patients

-   Genes and microorganisms that are related to IBD patients while controlling for environmental factors.

    -   Only related to Crohn's disease

    -   Only related to ulcerative colitis

    -   Related to both

-   Effect of the genes and microorganisms related to the IBD.
