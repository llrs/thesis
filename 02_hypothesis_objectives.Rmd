# Hypothesis and objectives

## Hypothesis

I hypothesize that the presence of certain microorganisms are related to the patient well being.
Furthermore, the expression state of the epithelium and the amount of bacterial presence might identify whether patients are suffering an IBD.
Finally, I believe that environmental factors interact with the IBD and are responsible of the big variability on the IBD discourse.

## Objectives

The main objective of the thesis is finding the relationships between microbiome and gene expression in the intestinal mucosa. For this reason weIdentify microorganisms and genes related to the IBD.

-   Identify how is the relationship between the intestine mucose gene expression and the microbiome present on the intestine. 

-   Find the influence of variables such as location (colon and ileum), the treatment received, IBD activity, sex, age, etc. in the microbiome and mucosa relationship.

-   Identify possible mechanism of interaction between the microbiome and mucosa
