Usually this involves looking how the metabolites, the gene expression, the methylation, the number of variants a gene has… is related to the observed phenotype. This then involve an integration between numeric and categorical. "],

Generally “old” statistics don’t consider this case. 1.3.2 More samples than variables This is the typical example when from a cohort of patients the temperature is measured along the stage of a disease, two variables for each sample "],

Sometimes because the piece of the patient obtained through surgery is not big enough to be divided into the different experiments needed. "],
