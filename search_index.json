The data I will be integrating are different omics data and the phenotype of the patients. This disease is complex and there are hypothesis pointing that the microbiome is a major factor in the disease. In the precision medicine framework data integration is important to consider all the relevant variables that influence a disease. The thesis is performed on the IDIBAPS research institute. My colleges are biologist, microbiologists, veterinaries... and we have weekly meetings with the doctors visiting at the nearby hospital. The thesis program allows one to defend the thesis after 3 years, and up to 5 in total. My timeline is to finish in 2022 after 3 years (I'll add it when it is finished to see how it went) with the guide of my thesis directors are Juanjo Lozano and Azucena Sala, who help as bioinformatician and disease expert respectively. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves Crohn's disease(CD) and ulcerative colitis(UC). It generally affects the terminal ileum and the colon but it can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. UC is a recurrent, chronic and continuous inflammation of the colon and rectum while the CD is not a continuous inflammation and affects the whole gastrointestinal tract. IBD etiology is unknown. However, once it has initiated the most prevalent hypothesis of its chronicity suggests an aberrant immunological response to antigens of the commensal microbiome. Treatments provided for the IBD are palliative. Those treatments include, noninflammatory drugs, suppressors and biologic. The therapeutic options can induce remission in some patients, however they often need continuous treatment to avoid recurrence. Nevertheless, many patients are refractory or intolerant to those therapies and need to undergo surgery. The disease present unique characteristics that require the usage of integration methods in order to find the specific relationship of the microbiome and the intestine on the disease. "],["integration.html", "1.1 Integration", " 1.1 Integration Integration is usually defined as: &quot;the process of combining two or more things into one&quot; --- Cambridge Dictionary Since the beginning of the integration methods there have been many methods proposed. Some of these methods are specific for one application or data while others are more general. On the recent years with the increase of more datasets with more variables than previously has seen an increase on the number of methodologies available on several disciplines but mainly on the biological science. This in turn has increased the importance of classification, review and comparison of the tools available, as well as, benchmarking these tools against the same dataset [1]. Other times only the strategies used are used to classify the methods [2]. As is common, there are several words that are used integrati(-on, -ve), multi-omics, pluri-omics. 1.1.1 Classification We can classify and characterize integration in several ways, here I outline some classifications in the bioscience field, with relationships (and references) to concrete methodology and usages. 1.1.1.1 Data type: numeric vs categorical The most important distinction in integration methods is what kind of data are combined. In general data can be divided between categorical and numeric values, which are usually found in several fields. Sometimes doctors want to understand the relationship between some phenotype they observe as a defined state from the underlying mechanistic point of view. Usually this involves looking how the metabolites, the gene expression, the methylation, the number of variants a gene has, and other numeric variables are related to the observed (categorical) phenotype (like pain). Depending on what is a method aimed for it handles both data types or just one, often they are used differently. The most common way to handle different type of data is converting the categorical values to a mock variable, where each number represents a category, then the methods use these values to correlate and relate the variables. If the categorical variable has three values (A, B, C) it would be converted to A (1, 0, 0) B (0, 1, 0) and C (0, 0, 1). 1.1.1.2 Aim The results and methods of data integration depend on the question they seek to answer and on the (biological) question. Most of the times one (or all) of the following results are expected: An overview of the role of each ‘omics in a biological system Sometimes several omics are used and the question is which omic method is the best one to describe the disease. Or several methods are used to understand better how two omics interact. A better understanding of the relationship (correlation) between the ’omics types When the relationship between omics is known there are methods to find those relationships and improve upon previous knowledge. For instance, checking that in a particular case or condition there is a given relationship, and that this relationships follows our model or not. A molecular signature1 leading to more insight into molecular mechanisms The usage of multifactor analysis might lead to the need to redefine the features that are essential for identifying a phase or a cell line. A predictive analytic model towards personalized medicine If a good model is known it can be used as a prediction if enough information is gathered, which might improve the treatment. 1.1.1.3 Relationship between variables and samples Depending on the amount of variables and in which samples they have been measures we can classify in two types of integration. Traditionally for each sample few variable has been measured, for instance for a tree only the height and width are measured, however with the new omics techniques (transcriptomics, metabolomics, methylomics, genomics), thousands of variables are measured for the same sample. More variables than samples: For a single sample of RNA around 50k genome identifiers (genes, long non coding RNAs, iRNA, pseudogenes,...) can be measured. High-throughput data analysis typically falls into the category of \\(p \\gg n\\) problems, where the number of genes or proteins, \\(p\\), is considerably larger than the number of samples, \\(n\\). Which leads to the case where there are (many) more variables than samples, generally &quot;old&quot; statistics don't consider this case, as it has its own complications like co-variance between the variables. When two variables are tightly correlated, discerning which is the lead and which is following is near to impossible. More samples than variables: An example would be when from a cohort of patients the temperature is measured along the stage of a disease: two variables for each sample. If in the cohort there are more than 2 patients, then the number of samples is greater than the number of variables studied. This is described in the literature as \\(n \\gg p\\). 1.1.1.4 Relationship between samples Depending on the relationship between the samples, the questions answerable and the methods available differ. If each sample has all the expected data we wanted to measure it is a complete case. Sometimes because the sample is not enough, or there are some technical or organizational problems we might lose a source of data for a sample (which is known as an incomplete case). This results in a new source of variation that has to be dealt with, which complicates the conclusion one can draw from the studies of these kind of data. Even when all the cases of a sample are complete the samples can come from several sites of the same individual or with different combinations of variables, which makes is relevant to understand. Time Time is one of the factors that sometimes cannot be controlled, despite having programmed visits every two weeks some patients might come early or later due to calendar reasons (holidays), family reasons, or disease state. Sometimes is precisely the object of the study, to see the relationships at different time, or see how the relationships change with time. Simultaneously is very important to consider it because two variables can seem correlated if we don't take time into consideration. Also, to discover causality between two variables the cause must be before the consequence, which highlights the importance of time. Being aware of the time differences and time scales is crucial in most cases. 1.1.1.5 Relationship between variables Since the lactose operon we know how some genes regulated between them, but for other variables we don't know how they are related. For instance how does the increase in expression of a gene affects the growth of a microorganism? It is important to note that some integration may lead to interactions while others don't, that is, the relationship of two different type of variables might be due to a physical relationship or through a more obscure relationship with no known direct contact. Network approaches relate the variables between them (such as [3]). 1.1.1.6 Input data Methods can be classified by the kind of input data required. Some of them need data from the same patients while other do not. Same samples data: These methods do not handle well or at all missing data. They need complete cases/data of the samples in order to be able to integrate the results. These methods include Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA) [4, 5], Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) [6], Multi-Study Factor Analysis (MSFA) [7], Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) [8], STATegRa [9] Different sample data: These methods do not need data from the same sample. They draw their conclusions generalizing from the the data available. Some of them handle missing data, while others do use the data at face value. These method includes HUMAnN 1.1.1.7 Output factors According to the output the integration methods can be classified in three groups: Shared factor across the data, specific factors for each data or mixed factors. Shared factors: The integration results in a vector of the samples in a lower dimensional space that is shared by all the data used to integrate. Such methods include iCluster, Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) [8] Specific factors: The integration results in several vectors of the samples in a lower dimensional space of each data used to integrate. Such methods include Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA) [4, 5], Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) [6], Multi-Study Factor Analysis (MSFA) [7] Mixed factors: The integration results in both previous factors, specific of each data and common to all the data. Such methods include Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE), integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization (intNMF). 1.1.1.8 Interpretation Understanding how to interpret the results of the methods is highly tight to understanding the method. If one does a correlation between two variables, the interpretation of the analysis is clear, if one variable increase, the other one too. However as more complicated methodologies are developed the interpretation becomes less clear, for instance how can one interpret the result of a canonical correlation analysis? Individually: How each variable relates to another, like in the correlation analysis, the relationship between two variables under study. Or by patient: how do interpret that in these patient variable A and B is X and Y? Globally: In a PCA for instance how do we interpret that some variables have the same loading? What happens in a more difficult method like canonical correlation analysis? There have been some articles about how to interpret those methods on real datasets [10]. Others, to benchmark and to learn how to interpret propose analyzing a simulated dataset [11, 12]. 1.1.1.9 Conclusion The field of integration is large and complex, with high interest in the recent days, specially in the psychology and omics field, which lacks of a large study. 1.1.2 Benchmarking The comparison of methods independently from original authors have become a crucial step for selecting the right tool for a research [13]. 1.1.3 Conclusions Bla bla A signature is usually a group of features that describe/are representative of a cell line or a process or a stage.↩ "],["IBD.html", "1.2 Inflammatory bowel disease", " 1.2 Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD is a chronic, progressive reincident disease that affects both terminal ilium and colon, but it can develop in any site of the gastrointestinal tract. The UC is a colonic reincident and chronic disease characterized by a continuous inflammation of the colon and rectum. Around 4,2 million individuals suffer from IBD in Europe and North America combined. The dysregulation of the inflammatory response observed in IBD requires interplay between host genetic factors and the intestinal microbiome. Several studies support the concept that IBD arise from an exacerbate immune response against commensal gut microorganisms. Nonetheless, the disease could result from an imbalanced microbial composition leading to generalized or localized dysbiosis2. The role of the gut microbiome in IBD is an ongoing field of research. Several authors are currently studying the alterations reported in IBD of the intestinal microbiome. However, it is still unclear the cause-effect relation between dysbiosis and IBD. Partly due to the multiple variables that might contribute to the disease progression; for instance, age, diet, usage of antibiotic, tobacco, environment, and eventually socioeconomic status. This could be due to both the genetic predisposition and environmental factors; for instance, bacterial or viral infection, diet, usage of antibiotic, and eventually the socioeconomic status. (see [14] ) The relationship between host and microbiome has been proposed to play a fundamental role to maintain the disease. Little is known of the influence of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the expression of the gastrointestinal tract. 1.2.1 Disease onset Differences between very early on-set and adult disease 1.2.2 Disease discourse Intermittent Disassociated between patient's report and colonoscopy 1.2.2.1 Treatments The ones given on the hospital more or less on the order of administration: anti-TNF\\(\\alpha\\) Vedolizumab Ustekinumab Risankizumab Tofacitinib surgery TRIM/HSCT 5-asa corticoesteroids Azathiprine/Mercaptopurine 6MCP Methotrexate MTX Tacrolimus FK Cyclosporin A CyA Infliximab Adalimumab Antibiotics 1.2.3 Integration on IBD One of the hypothesis behind the maintenance of the inflammation involves the microbiome. Several studies have been carried out to discover links between microbiome and the inflammation. Some of these studies used metabolites, DNA-seq sequencing of the microbiome content, or targeted 16S sequencing. Also the technical method used can differ between extracted from stools or from biopsied samples at colonoscopy or from surgical samples. Some articles use correlation like [15]. There are others that use a combination of methods Very rarely there is an experimental confirmation. This is due to how complicated it is to test an interaction and the simulate the conditions. One of the few methods published were the interaction is measured is to expose the ex-vivo sample or cell line with supernatant of a microbiome culture. Previous methods used include the use of RGCCA, [16] [17] 1.2.4 Summary The integration of data might help to improve the medicine and reveal links in difficult diseases like IBD. A signature is usually a group of features that describe/are representative of a cell line or a process or a stage.↩ "],["rgcca.html", "Chapter 2 RGCCA", " Chapter 2 RGCCA The canonical correlation is a method that using data from the same sample but from different datasets.
