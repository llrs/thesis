# Introduction

Integration is usually defined as
>  the process of combining two or more things into one

We can classify and explore integration in several ways, here I outline some classifications in the field of bioscience.

## Data type: numeric vs categorical

Sometimes doctors want to understand the relationship between some phenotype they observe as a defined state from the underlying mechanistic point of view. Usually this involves looking how the metabolites, the gene expression, the methylation, the number of variants a gene has... is related to the observed phenotype.

This then involve an integration between numeric and categorical.

## Goal
By goal we can define to clear objectives:
- Explore two sets of variables to find how do they combine
- Knowing beforehand how two sets of variables are related explore them in a given case
### New relationships
When there isn't any information about how two sets of variables relate, for instance how the methylation affects the microorganism of the gastrointestinal tract.
### Explore known relationships
If we already know that X is related to Y, we need to check if this holds or not. 
## Relationship between variables and samples
### More variables than samples
The new techniques of transcriptomics, metabolomics, methylomics, genomics are based on evaluating a large amount of variables of a single sample, which lead to the case where there are (many) more variables than samples. Generally "old" statistics don't consider this case.
### More samples than variables
This is the typical example when from a cohort of patients the temperature is measured along the stage of a disease, two variables for each sample
## Relationship between samples
Each sample has the correspondent sample on the other data-set or not, so if for the same patient we can measure the transcriptomics, the metabolomics and the methylation at the same time it is XXXX.
Sometimes because the piece of the patient obtained through surgery is not big enough to be divided into the different experiments needed.
## Time
In the case of the man who has a cold, and we measure the temperature we could observe that all the evenings he has fevers, but if we measured it in the mornings we could see that the fever is disappearing with the days on the morning.
## Relationship between the variables
Since the lactose operon we know how some genes regulated between them, but for other variables we don't know how they are related. For instance how does the increase in expression of a gene affects the growth of a microorganism?
## Interpretation
If one does a correlation between two variables, the interpretation of the analysis is clear, if one variable increase, the other too. However how can one interpret a canonical correlation analysis
### Individually
How each variable relates to another, like in the correlation analysis. 
### Globally
How the grouped variables relates to other groups, or within them?
