The main topic of the thesis is [data integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration) applied in the [inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease) research.
The data I will be integrating are different omics data and the phenotype of the patients.
This disease is complex and there are hypothesis pointing that the [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota) is a major factor in the disease.
In the precision medicine framework data integration is important to consider all the relevant variables that influence a disease.

The thesis is performed on the [IDIBAPS](http://www.idibaps.org/) research institute.
My colleges are biologist, microbiologists, veterinaries... and we have weekly meetings with the doctors visiting at the nearby hospital.

The thesis program allows one to defend the thesis after 3 years, and up to 5 in total.
My timeline is to finish in 2022 after 4 years (I'll add it when it is finished to see how it went) with the guide of my thesis directors [Juanjo Lozano](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7613-3908) and [Azucena Sala](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4572-2907), who help as bioinformatician and disease expert respectively.
