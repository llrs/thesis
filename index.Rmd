The main topic of the thesis is [data integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration "Wikipedia page of integration") applied in the [inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease) research.
This disease is complex, for instance it is not know if the cause behind Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is the same.
There are hypothesis pointing that the [microbiome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota) is a major factor in the disease, which together with an aberrant immune response is the dominant theory.
In order to find robust relationships between the mcirobiome and the immune system it is important to consider all the relevant variables that influence a disease.
On this thesis I seek these relationships using data from different sequencing technologies and the observed or reported phenotype of the patients.

The thesis was carried out on the [Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS)](http://www.idibaps.org/ "IDIBAPS website") research institute and funded by [Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red (CIBER)](https://www.ciberehd.org/ "CIBER website").
The thesis was done on [the inflammatory bowel disease unit](https://www.ibd-bcn.org/ "Group's website") which is a translational team of biologist, microbiologists, veterinaries, bioinformaticians, doctors and nurses (at [Hospital Clínic](https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en "Hospital Clínic")) in a multidisciplinary team.
The leading doctor of the unit was [Julian Panés](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4971-6902 "Julià website") whose interest on the disease lead to receiving a grant that made possible this thesis.

The thesis is under the [doctoral programme in biomedicine](http://www.ub.edu/doctorat_biomedicina/eng/index.htm "Doctoral program's website") of the [University of Barcelona (UB)](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/ "UB website").
My thesis directors' were [Juanjo Lozano](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7613-3908 "Juanjo's ORCID") and [Azucena Sala](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4572-2907 "Azu's ORCID"), my boss, who helped as bioinformatician and disease expert respectively.
They provided advice and guidance on how to analyse the data and where to focus on the different experiments/analysis.
