# Online resources

Some links that I found useful on the thesis and could be useful if you are
interested on the multi-omics field.

-   [Awesome multi-omics](https://github.com/mikelove/awesome-multi-omics): An
    online repository of references to multi-omics methods.
-   [Bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/): The book about how to
    write this type of books.

# Software

Along the years of this thesis several pieces of software have been generated as
well as packages. Here they are listed for easier retrieval. They are listed on
two ways, one with a brief explanation and another one ordered by what software
piece is used on each analysis.

## Listed

An improved/tested version of [RGCCA](https://github.com/llrs/RGCCA), some
modifications on the internal functions to ease the maintenance as well as
adding tests and sometimes improving the documentation. Also modified so that it
is possible to provide a vector of models so that the model of the first
dimension is not the same as the model on the second dimension (not sure if
mathematically speaking makes sense but from a biological one I think it might
be interesting to have it).

Designed to be used with RGCCA I wrote
[inteRmodel](https:github.com/llrs/inteRmodel) to ease the bootstrapping and
model selection.

A package to design batches to avoid batch effect
[experDesign](https://cran.r-project.org/package=experDesign) and its website on
[GitHub](https://github.com/llrs/experDesign)

A package to analyze sets and fuzzy sets
[BaseSet](https://github.com/llrs/BaseSet). This package was meant to be used
with the probabilities that arise from bootstrapping the models. However due to
the long times of calculation that it would require it was not used. (A previous
iteration of the package called [GSEAdv](https://github.com/llrs/GSEAdv) was
developed too.)

## By publication

All code of the analysis of the publications is available (in his messed state
and complicated history) and a brief description as to why they were used:

[Multi-omic modelling of inflammatory bowel disease with regularized canonical
correlation analysis](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20031492):

-   [TRIM](https://github.com/llrs/TRIM): Mangle with the sample, dataset,
    explore several methods...
-   [sgcca\_hyperparameters](https://github.com/llrs/sgcca_hyperparameters):
    Explore the effects of the hyperparameters on RGCCA on the provided dataset.
-   [inteRmodel](https://github.com/llrs/inteRmodel): Package for easy repeating
    the methodology developed on TRIM.
-   [integration](https://github.com/llrs/integration-helper): Package with
    functions that I wrote several times on the TRIM ended up here.

Paper 2:

-   [Barcelona](https://github.com/llrs/Barcelona): Mangle with the sample,
    dataset ...
-   [inteRmodel](https://github.com/llrs/inteRmodel): To repeat the same
    procedure as in the first analysis.
-   [integration](https://github.com/llrs/integration-helper): To not repeat
    myself for the same process.
