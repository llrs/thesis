<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease">Inflammatory bowel disease</a> (IBD) involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease">Crohn’s disease</a> (CD) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis">ulcerative colitis</a> (UC).
It generally affects the terminal ileum and the colon but it can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract.
UC is a recurrent, chronic and continuous inflammation of the colon and rectum while the CD is not a continuous inflammation and affects the whole gastrointestinal tract causing transmural inflammation.</p>
<p>IBD etiology is unknown.
However, once it has initiated the most prevalent hypothesis of its chronicity suggests an aberrant immunological response to antigens of the commensal microbiome.</p>
<p>To diagnose IBD doctors use endoscopy and/or magnetic resonance imaging and histologies.</p>
<p>Treatments provided for IBD include, noninflammatory drugs, suppressors and biologics, i.e, anti TNF- anti-IL2, 23, anti-integrin <span class="math inline">\(\alpha4\beta7\)</span>.
The therapeutic options can induce remission in some patients, but they often need continuous treatment to avoid recurrence.
Nevertheless, many patients are refractory or intolerant to those therapies and need to undergo surgery or other strategies like dietetic and psychological support <span class="citation">[1]</span> .</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Inflammatory bowel disease<a href="introduction.html#IBD" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>IBD includes the CD and UC which are characterized by alternating periods of remission and clinical relapse that mainly affect the gastrointestinal tract.
CD is a progressive relapsing disease that can affect all the gastrointestinal tract but shows mostly on both terminal ileum and colon with a discontinuous inflammation.
UC is a colonic relapsing disease characterized by continuous inflammation of the colon.
Both of them have different risk factors, clinical, endoscopic an histological characteristics (see sections <a href="introduction.html#CD">1.1.2</a> and <a href="introduction.html#UC">1.1.3</a> ).</p>
<p>Around 3.5 million individuals have IBD in Europe and North America combined <span class="citation">[2]</span>.
IBD is more commonly found in industrialized and developed regions, suggesting that environmental factors might greatly influence IBD occurrence.
In addition, the incidence of IBD is increasing in areas, such as Asia or Eastern Europe, where the number of cases was relatively low hitherto <span class="citation">[3]</span>.</p>
<p>The dysregulation of the inflammatory response observed in IBD requires interplay between host genetic factors and the intestinal microbiome.
Several studies support the concept that IBD arise from an exacerbate immune response against commensal gut microorganisms.
Nonetheless, the disease could result from an imbalanced microbial composition leading to generalized or localized dysbiosis<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The role of the gut microbiome in IBD is an active ongoing field of research.
Several authors are currently studying the alterations reported in IBD of the intestinal microbiome.
However, it is still unclear the cause-effect relation between dysbiosis and IBD.
Partly due to the multiple variables already identified that have been linked to IBD; for instance, age, diet, usage of antibiotic, tobacco, and socioeconomic status <span class="citation">[4, 5]</span>.</p>
<p>The relationship between host and microbiome has been proposed to play a fundamental role in maintaining disease.
For instance, some <em>Proteobacteria</em> species which have adherent and invasive properties might exploit host defenses and promote a proinflammatory environment, altering the intestinal microbiota in favor of dysbiosis <span class="citation">[6]</span>.</p>
<p>The epithelium is often damaged and might present ulcers or other inflammation symptoms.
A segment of the gastrointestinal tract might recover if the patient receives treatment or due the natural cycles of the disease.
But once a segment is affected by the disease it can be considered as involved, as some damage remains even if the tissues is no longer inflammed.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Etiology and pathogenesis<a href="introduction.html#etiology-and-pathogenesis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to drive IBD pathogenesis <span class="citation">[7, 8]</span>.
Some of them are based on a relationship between the immune system and the microbiome <span class="citation">[9, 10]</span>.
It is also unclear if CD and the UC share the same origin considering their different symptoms.</p>
<p>There is also evidence of some genetic component on the onset of the disease, specially if the disease appears very early (less than 2 years old patients) <span class="citation">[11, 12]</span>.
Disease can be classified based on age at onset as very early, early or adult on-set disease <span class="citation">[12]</span>.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked IBD to over 100 genetic loci, including a <em>NOD2</em> gene, but so far there is not any known mechanism how polymorfism on this genes are driving the disease <span class="citation">[13]</span>.
On early pedriatic and adult disease the genetic component is lower than on very early on set and it is thought that the environmental factors are the main cause of the disease at those ages.</p>
<p>On the following sections we will explore the role of several of the possible factors involved on the pahtogenesis, starting with the genetics.</p>
<div id="genetics" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.1.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.1</span> Genetics<a href="introduction.html#genetics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>IBD is not an heritable disease, except for very early onset IBD, but it has some genetic influence that predisposes people to have it.</p>
<p>This has lead to look for genetic factors on IBD both on general population and on the early cases.
Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are one of the most common genetic studies performed, together with methylation studies.
To discover through linkage desequilibrium genetic variations linked to phenotypes and regulatory transcription changes, respectively.</p>
<p>With GWAS several allels on protein coding loci have been found, rising to around 300 genetic variants <span class="citation">[14]</span>.
Particularly, the <em>NOD2</em> gene is highly relevant for the disease on European patients, as it is a risk alleles for CD loci but show significant protective effects in UC <span class="citation">[15, 16]</span>.
The mechanism of how this gene protects from UC has not been confirmed yet <span class="citation">[13]</span>.</p>
<p>Many of the relevant genetic loci related to IBD are not on protein coding fragments of the genome.
Recently expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) particularly showed <span class="citation">[11]</span> that locis are on enhancers or promoters like e.g.
H3K27Ac or promoter e.g.
H3K4me1 marks as found by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP_sequencing" title="Wikipedia: ChIP-seq">ChIP-Seq</a>).</p>

<!--# Aida 2.3 p24-->
<p>The human intestine is a large reservoir of co-existing microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and unicellular eukaryotes) .
This microbiome community exerts different functions in the human body influencing nutrients’ metabolism, the maturation of the immune system while suppressing the growth of harmful microorganisms’ <span class="citation">[17]</span>.</p>
<p>The role of the gut microbiota has been proposed to play a role in IBD pathogenesis.
IBD has been characterized by a breakdown in the balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria that are present in the human gut compared to healthy individuals <span class="citation">[18, 19]</span>.</p>
<!--# End-->
<!--# Elena tesis p18-->
<p>Indeed, many studies show that patients with IBD have less biodiversity.
Biodiversity is measured on <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (alfa) and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> (beta) diversity.
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-diversity is a measure of the species present on a single sample and its abundance while <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-diversity compares the diversity between samples.
There are some reports of taxonomic changes and increase on <em>Enterobacteriaceae sp</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em> (specially the invasive strain) at the mucosal layer of IBD patients <span class="citation">[20]</span>.
At the same time there is often a reduction of protective species like <em>Bifidobacterium</em>, <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Faecalibacterium</em> which might be able to protect individuals from mucosal inflammation via several mechanism such as a downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines or the stimulation of IL-10 and antiinflammatory cytokines <span class="citation">[20]</span>.
Specially <em>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</em> is one microorganism of interest <span class="citation">[21, 22]</span>.</p>
<!--# Aida 2.3 p24-->
<p>In fact, it has been recently proposed that several unique microbial species can distinguish healthy controls from UC and CD patients <span class="citation">[23, 24]</span>.</p>

<p>One of the proposed mechanism of crosstalk between bacteria and host is through bacterial metabolites.
They interact with the cells and modulate the state of the intestine.
One example of such metabolite is butyrate which has been linked to microorganisms presents on healthy intestines and shown to interact with intestine cells and help regulate some genes <span class="citation">[25]</span>.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, adherent invasive <em>Escherichia coli</em>, a proteobacteria specie, has been associated with IBD <span class="citation">[26]</span>.
Adherent invasive strains are mainly found in ileal and colonic samples of CD patients and their presence in UC is less clear.
These adherent invasive cells enter through the epithelium of the more permeable cells and live on their cytosol.</p>

<p>As explained previously the immune system plays a role in IBD pathogenesis and pathophysiology.</p>
<p>Loss of tolerance to commensal bacteria has been suggested as the underlying mechanism triggering the inflammation on the intestine.
The immune response involves many different cells lines and regions, which are important to know how they organize for a better understanding of the disease.</p>

Figure 1.2: The intestinal epithelial barrier.
</p>
</div>
<p>From the luminal side of the intestine, the first layer is the mucosa (See sections <a href="introduction.html#fig:barrier">1.2</a> or <a href="introduction.html#fig:composition">1.1</a>).
In the colon the mucus is organized in two layers: the inner layer, a firm mucus layer; and the outer, loose mucus layer <span class="citation">[32]</span>.
The intestinal epithelium is a single layer of cells organized into crypts and villi (and circular folds on the large intestine) that carries out a diverse array of functions besides digestion performed by specialized cell lineages.</p>
<!--# From tesis Aida p20 Immune Response -->
<p>Immune response in the intestinal mucous is mainly excreted by the gut associated lymphoid tissue <span class="citation">[33]</span>.
Genetically predisposed patients when exposed to certain environmental factors activate immune responses against microbials or self-antigens which in turn, may impair the mucosal barrier of the intestinal mucosa, the first physical barrier on the mucosal surface.</p>
<p>Both the adaptive and the innate immune cells are present in the intestine, right below the epithelium.
On IBD due to antigen translocation into the lamina propria, the immune response leads the adaptive cells to generate immune response to harmless components of the intestinal microbiota.
This initial response induces a local increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators which damages the mucosa.
Therefore, the loss of integrity on this barrier enables the intestinal luminal bacteria to access the intestinal epithelium and to interact with the immune system underneath it more directly <span class="citation">[34]</span>.</p>
<p>The intestinal epithelium is another line of defense against bacterial invasion.
Intestinal epithelial cells play a key role in controlling the integrity of the physical barrier to the intestinal microorganisms <span class="citation">[34]</span> not only physically but also secreting antimicrobial peptides and defensins, both of which are altered in IBD patients <span class="citation">[35]</span>.
The intestinal epithelium also plays a key role on the intake and diffusion of metabolites from the intestinal lumen to the lamina propia.</p>
<p>Damaging or increasing the permeability of the intestinal epithelium results on a response from the immune system.
Detecting signals of any foreign particle can also trigger the immune system.
On the intestine this starts with the identification of these signals by intestinal epithelial cells have pattern recognition receptors.
There are two main pattern recognition receptors: toll-like receptors (TLR), which are present on the surface, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NOD-like receptors), present on the cytoplasm of the cells.
These receptors upon recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) start an amplifying signaling producing chemokines and cytokines which activates the transcription and translation of pro-inflammatory mediators to ensure an effective immune response.
Initially the innate response is triggered but the cells also increase the antigen presentation to T cells and thus activate the immune adaptive response <span class="citation">[36]</span>.</p>
<p>Other cell types, such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells also present the pattern recognition receptors.
From those, macrophages and dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells too and secrete several cytokines to activate other immune cells.
Usually CD patients express higher amounts of TLR than healthy individuals, which might trigger a stronger immune response.
This response is driven by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells proliferation in secondary lymphoid tissues to T helpers in the presence of the antigens and cytokines nearby.</p>
<p>T helpers (T<sub>h</sub>) differentiate depending of the cytokines at which they are exposed.
Th type 1 are driven by exposure to IL-12 secreted primarily by dentritic cells.
T<sub>h</sub>2 are driven by cytokines secreted by macrophages.
The imbalance between T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2-promoting cytokines determines the intensity and duration of the inflammatory response in experimental colitis <span class="citation">[37]</span>.</p>
<p>T<sub>h</sub>17-promoting cytokines are less well characterized in human.
T<sub>reg</sub> cells differentiate after exposure to cytokines IL-10, IFN-<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and TGF-<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.
Overall the presence of certain cytokines and the response to self-antigens are factors leads to an inflammation and damage that is related to the onset and establishment of IBD</p>

<p>On these kind of diseases autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has shown some benefits on IBD <span class="citation">[38]</span>.
The benefit of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in autoimmunity is thought to originate from the depletion of auto-reactive cells regardless of their specificity.
However, due to its associated risk this therapy is only given when patients are refractory to all available therapeutic options.</p>

<p>Chronic inflammatory disorders and neoplasms have become the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the countries with high standards of personal cleanliness.
A decrease in human exposure to microbes or hygene which might affect the proper maturation of the immune system so that it provides less immune response or exacerbated response towards “friendly” microbes <span class="citation">[39, 40]</span>.</p>
<p>From other environmental factors related to IBD such as tobacco, diet, certain drugs and stress; tobacco is the most influential environmental factor.
Surprisingly, it has an opposite effect on UC and CD: in CD tobacco is a risk factor that increases the risk of relapse and/or surgical intervention.
In UC, it has been observed that smoking cessation worsens the disease <span class="citation">[41]</span>.</p>
<p>Pharmacological treatments such as oral contraceptives, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also related to develop or relapse the disease <span class="citation">[42, 43]</span>.</p>
<p>The psychological welfare of people also plays an important role in the disease progression, stress, anxiety and depression might be important in relapse and deterioration of the disease <span class="citation">[44]</span>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> CD physiology<a href="introduction.html#CD" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As previously introduced, CD is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by a discontinuous inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
Inflammation on the gastrointestinal tract is transmural and can affect from the mouth to the anus, but mainly it manifests on the ileum and colon <span class="citation">[10]</span>.
It is frequently associated with extraintestinal manifestation and/or concomitant immune-mediated diseases.</p>
<!--# Clinical presentation -->
<p>The disease itself manifest an heterogeneous symptoms that can involve, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, anorexia and malaise.
Other less frequent co-occurring manifestations are arthritis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, skin disorders venous or arterial thromboembolism and/or pulmonary involvement <span class="citation">[45]</span> .
These symptoms make it hard to correctly diagnose the disease by non-specialists, in addition there is not a non invasive easy procedure to diagnose it.
All these can lead to delays on correct diagnosis of the disease.</p>
<!--# Tesis Ana p21-->
<p>The detection of parasites or bacteria, such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, have been associated with CD <span class="citation">[46]</span>.
The detection of fecal calprotectin, is generally a good marker of endoscopic activity with sensitivity above 70% and specificity above 80% <span class="citation">[47, 48]</span>.</p>
<!--# End-->
<p>Usually the best diagnosis method is to perform a colonoscopy, whether there is inflammation on the gastrointestinal tract on discontinuous regions then is CD.
This inflammation could also present ulceration with rectal sparing and histological lesions which also help to diagnose the patients <span class="citation">[49]</span>.</p>
<!--# Check with Elena Basolas Tesis p18-->
<p>Usually on CD a granulome, that is a region with big multinucleous cells, can appear on any intestinal layer.
In addition to the inflamed location(s), mosaic zones (patches of inflamed and non-inflamed areas) are more characteristic of CD <span class="citation">[50]</span>.</p>
<!--# End -->
<p>The Montreal classification aims to classify patients according to their age of disease onset, standardized anatomical disease location an disease behavior.
This classification assumes that the location of CD remains stable over time after diagnosis but behavioral phenotypes change.
Other scores consider area affected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Montreal classification allows for early onset of disease to be categorized separately those with age of diagnosis at 16 years or younger, diagnosis at 17–40 years and &gt;40 years, respectively <span class="citation">[12]</span>.</li>
<li>SES-CD: simple endoscopic score for CD <span class="citation">[51]</span>. Score based on size of ulcers, ulcerate surface percentage, affected surface and presence of narrowing on the bowel.</li>
<li>CDAI: CD Activity Index takes into account weight, ideal body weight, sex, and events on the last week such as liquid stools, abdominal pain, general well-being and if anti-diarrhea drug usage, as well as knowing if there are fistulas, fever, and other complications <span class="citation">[52]</span></li>
</ul>
<!--# Add Figure 2 from ACM thesis?-->
<p>To some extent, there is a disassociation between clinical symptoms and the endoscopy finding.
Often patients report feeling better despite lack of muscular healing <span class="citation">[53]</span>.
To overcome this disassociation and be able to compare the well-being of patients several scores and thresholds are used on research and by physicians that will be described later.</p>
<!--# Disease course -->
<p>In the early stages of the disease the relapsing and remitting course is more frequent.
Often relapses are accompanied by clinical symptoms, and few have prolonged clinical remission (without treatment) <span class="citation">[54]</span>.
When there is clinical remission, there can still remain some other lesions and often subclinical inflammation persists.
Frequently the damage caused by the disease evolves to fibrostenotic stricture or penetrating lesions (fistula and abscess).</p>
<p>Damage of the disease might not be apparent to patients and might be only seen several years later than the first detection <span class="citation">[53]</span>.
Mucosal healing is a first step towards the healing of deeper layers of the inflamed bowel wall on the CD.</p>
<p>Patients might progress from an inflammatory phenotype to a stricturing or penetrating one <span class="citation">[12]</span>.
Stricturing is a narrowing of a part of the intestine often because of scar tissue and fibrosis in its wall.
Penetrating is when the epithelium has some holes or tubes.
If these tubes result in an abnormal connection between two body parts it is a fistula, it might also result in an abcess, a collections of pus, often developed in the abdomen, pelvis, or around the anal area.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> UC physiology<a href="introduction.html#UC" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As previously introduced, UC is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by a continuous inflammation of the colon.
Depending on the inflamed segments of the intestine it is classified in several phenotypes.</p>
<p>Around a third of the patients with UC suffer proctitis, the inflammation of the rectum.
If the segments from rectum to the sigmoid colon are affected is a distal colitis, if it affects the left colon then it becomes a left colitis.
If the inflammation continues to the descending colon it is then an extensive colitis until it affects the whole colon when it becomes a pancolitis.
The extension of UC is inversely related to the frequency.
However, the extension and severity of the disease correlates: the prognosis is worse the more extended it is <span class="citation">[55]</span>.
In addition, the damage usually consists in many neutrophil in the lumen crypt <span class="citation">[50]</span>.</p>
<!--# Clinical care -->
<p>The goal of the clinical care is to recover.
As a first step, the symptoms of IBD have to lessen to the point that they are mostly absent, gone, or barely noticeable, this is known as clinical remission.
However, this is not enough as the mucosa might be still inflamed and thus the reconstitution of the structure and function of the intestinal mucosa is not complete.
Other lesions, might aid to the progression to other phenotypes such as fibrostenotic stricture or penetrating lesions or primary sclerosing cholangitis <span class="citation">[56]</span>.</p>
<p>To prevent and avoid further damage several procedures are followed:</p>
<p>When there is dysplasia, an abnormal development of cells within tissues or organs (which is considered a precedence before colorectal cancer growth <span class="citation">[57]</span>), or the damage on the colon has been too big a surgical procedure to remove part or all of the colon must be done.<br />
Patients that undergo a colectomy need to have their bowel reconnected with a procedure called ileoanal anastomosis (also know as J-pouch by the shape it takes) surgery.
Often the lining of the pouch created during surgery becomes inflamed on what is known as pouchitis <span class="citation">[58]</span>.</p>
<p>Many scores have been proposed for several purposes, from quality of life to disease severity or patient status.
Among the scores most used are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mayo: A score designed to be simple to calculate based on stool frequency, bleeding, mucosal appearance at endoscopy and physicians assessment <span class="citation">[59]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>IBDQ: A 32 questionnaire used to assess the quality of life grouped into four categories: bowel, systemic, social and emotional <span class="citation">[60]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>UCEDIS: An endoscopic score based on vascular pattern, internal bleeding and erosion and ulcers <span class="citation">[61]</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other measured parameters include, weight, effective weight, fecal calprotectin, C reactive protein and hemoglobine.</p>

<p>Current treatment attempt to induce and keep the remission of patients and reduce secondary effects of the disease instead of revert the pathogenic mechanisms.
As standard of care corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and immunosuppressor and some other drugs like antibiotics or metronidazol are util in some cases.</p>
<p>Acid 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA or mesalazina, pentasa) can be given in a topic way (either liquid, enemas, or suppository) or in oral form (pills or dilutions).
In CU it helps in the clinic remission but it does not always mean that there is remission (is twice much likely than placebo to reach remission) <span class="citation">[62]</span>.
On CD the effects are not so stark and generally it does not produce changes on the disease <span class="citation">[63]</span>.</p>
<p>Antibiotics, such as metronidazol and ciprofloxacina, are effective to deal with secondary effects of IBD such as abscess and bacterian overgrowth in CD <span class="citation">[64, 65]</span>, but they do not seem effective on UC <span class="citation">[65]</span>.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids can be taken orally, such as prednisolona, prednisona and Budesonide; intravenous, hidrocortisona, metilprednisolona; or via enemas and suppositories.
Budesonide is not absorved well and has a limited biodistribution but it has good therapeutic benefits with a reduced systemic toxicity in IBD <span class="citation">[54, 66]</span>.
These drugs work very well as antiinflammatory for mild or severe IBD but do not work well as maintenance drug <span class="citation">[67, 68]</span>.</p>
<p>Thiopurines (Azathioprine, mercaptopurina) are immunosuppressants drugs that deactivate key process of limphocytes T that might trigger the inflammation.
As a side effect they are toxic due to their interaction with nucleic acids <span class="citation">[69]</span>.
on CD they are useful to induce and keep remission <span class="citation">[70]</span>, while on UC they are used to keep the remission <span class="citation">[71]</span>.</p>
<p>In the last two decades IBD treatment has moved from aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunomodulators to anti-TNF<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.
Anti-TNF<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> drugs has changed IBD treatment as it reduced the hospitalization associated with previous treatments, reducing medical costs and risk of surgery as well as induce a better mucosal healing and quality of life for patients <span class="citation">[72]</span>.
However, 20-30% of patients have no response to this treatments and another 30-40% lose response in a year <span class="citation">[73]</span>.</p>
<!--# Pause to give names of drugs used on other targets previously mentioned -->
<p>Recently a new wave of drugs has been developed targeting different molecules such as vedolizumab, targeting anti-integrin<span class="math inline">\(\alpha 4 \beta 7\)</span>, ustekinumab, targeting both IL-12 and IL-23, risankizumab an anti IL-23, tofacitinib an inhibitor of JAKs, infliximab an anti-TNF<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>Patients might become refractory to drug.
Thus, drugs do not have the same effect as previously and the dose might need to be increased with the risk of more secondary effects <span class="citation">[1]</span>.
Surgery resection might be needed on these patients.</p>
<!--# Back to Elena -->
<p>Close to 35% of patients with UC will need to have a surgery resection, either due to complications or because the inflammation can not be controlled.
Surgery usually removes the inflamed segment of the colon.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Summary<a href="introduction.html#summary-ibd" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>IBD is a complex disease that impacts the health of many people for long time and with lasting impact on their quality of life.</p>
<p>Current clinical care in some cases is enough to have a sustained clinical and endoscopic remission but most often is not enough and relapse is expected.
Several factors, such as becoming refractory to drugs, intermittent course of the disease and lack of validated predictors of disease course or response to therapy make the treatment complex.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge of what are the factors cause of the disease make those treatments and drugs to be addressed to block further inflammation and damage, but cannot prevent it and often they do not stop it completely.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Integration studies on IBD<a href="introduction.html#integration-studies-on-ibd" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Many studies have looked up to the origin of the disease.
As seen, one of the hypothesis behind the maintenance of the inflammation involves the microbiome and the host epithelium.
This has been studied using several data sources, mostly from sequencing data.
The technical methods used to obtain the data of the inflamed tissue differ between extracted from biopsied samples at colonoscopy or from surgical samples.</p>
<p>Those samples are usually used later on to diagnose or for research purpose.
To obtain research-quality data it usually imply using techniques such as immunohistochemistry, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction.
These techniques allow to measure or visualize where are the cells expressing certain proteins or genes, thus helping with the analysis validation.</p>
<p>Furthermore several studies have been carried out to discover links between microbiome and the inflammation, followed by those looking for some relationship between genetics and the disease and more recently the metabolome.
These studies, known as integration, multi-omic or interaction studies, usually use multiple sequencing assays as the bases of the analysis <span class="citation">[79]</span>.</p>
<p>However, confirming causal interactions of the variables of each essay is difficult.
To find relationships some articles use correlation <span class="citation">[80]</span>, there are others that use a combination of methods from correlations, partial correlations to integrative methods <span class="citation">[81–83]</span> and network integrations <span class="citation">[82]</span>.</p>
<p>Very rarely there is an experimental confirmation of the relationships between variables of the different assays because it is complicated to test an interaction and to set up the right conditions for the many variables that are accounted for on the integrations.
One of the few methods published that shows an interaction between genes and microorganisms on IBD is to expose the <em>ex-vivo</em> sample or cell lines with microbiomes or supernatant of at their culture <span class="citation">[84]</span>.</p>

The transcriptome of patients derived samples has been extensively studied since the existence of microarrays.
There are known marker gens of inflammation and many research focus on identifying prognosis predictors and treatment response prediction based on gene expression <span class="citation">[85–87]</span>.
Recently single-cell RNA-seq technology has enabled to estimate cell populations of the samples with better degree of success than bulk RNA-sequencing.

These studies use datasets from IBD patients usually stratified by disease activity or severity of inflammation or location of the disease.
Most of them are based on correlation analysis between the microbiome and RNA-seq <span class="citation">[80]</span>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Integration<a href="introduction.html#integration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The term “data integration” is widely used with varying meanings.
According to the dictionary integration is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the process of combining two or more things into one” — <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/integration">Cambridge Dictionary</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other words used are integration, and if specific to data from sequencing technologies, multi-omics or pluri-omics.
Here integration will be used as it is the more general one and not restricted to omics or sequencing technologies.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the integration methods there have been many methods proposed <span class="citation">[95]</span>.
Some of the early methods were initially used for surveying the agreement of different evaluating systems <span class="citation">[96]</span>, others were developed for agricultural sciences <span class="citation">[97]</span> or food industry <span class="citation">[98]</span>.
Some of these methods are specific for one application or data type while others are more generally applicable.
Lately, the access to bigger datasets with more variables and often from the same samples has increased the focus of the research community on the methodologies available on several disciplines but mainly on biological sciences.
The explosion of data on biological sciences has been driven by the new sequencing technologies that allow to measure thousand of variables of many samples at the same time.
If done with multiple sequencing technologies it is usually referred as multi-omics methods, which usually only uses omic data.</p>
<p>It is crucial to classify, review and compare tools available, as well as, to benchmark these tools against the same dataset as a way to provide clear recommendations to anyone wishing to use them <span class="citation">[99]</span>.
Part of these efforts use the methods’ strategies to classify them <span class="citation">[100, 101]</span>.
Following this view we will review the available integration methods according to several axes: type of data used, aim of the method, relationships between variables, relationships between samples, relationship between variables and samples, input data, mathematical framework and results of the method.</p>
<div id="classification-of-integration-methods" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Classification of integration methods<a href="introduction.html#classification-of-integration-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Integration methods have very different properties that allow them to be classified and compared <span class="citation">[102]</span>.
Here we classify those meant to be used with omics datasets, with references to concrete methodology and in occasionally to articles using them.</p>

<div id="data-type-numeric-or-categorical" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.1</span> Data type: numeric or categorical<a href="introduction.html#data-type-numeric-or-categorical" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The most important distinction in integration methods is what kind of data are combined.
In general data can be divided between categorical and numeric variables, which are usually found in several fields.
Sometimes clinicians want to understand the relationship between a phenotype they observe and the underlying mechanism.
Usually this involves looking how metabolites, gene expression, methylation, number of variants a gene has, and other numeric variables are related to the observed phenotype (i.e. pain).</p>
<p>Depending on the method’s aim it handles numeric and categorical data types or just one.
Often they are used differently.
The most common way to handle different types of data is converting the categorical values to a mock or dummy variable.
For each categorical factor there is a new variable whose value is 1 if that sample had this factor and 0 otherwise.
For instance, if the categorical variable has three values (A, B, C) it would be converted to A (1, 0, 0) B (0, 1, 0) and C (0, 0, 1).
Often the number of variables created is one less than the number of factors that existed, on this example only A and B would be kept.
This transformation allows to use categorical values as numeric variables.</p>
<p>If the method only accepts categorical data but you want to provide numeric values usually those values are categorized.
For example if a variable is (0.123, 0.25, 0.56, 0.78) one could make to categorical values like (“&lt;0.5”, “&lt;0.5”, “&gt;0.5”, “&gt;0.5”).
The number of categories to use and how the numeric value splits depends on each case.</p>
<p>Very rarely methods allow to use both data types as they are.
If they allow so, it is usually for classification purposes only.</p>

</div>
<div id="objective" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.2</span> Objective<a href="introduction.html#objective" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The objective of any method is one of its most important defining properties.
Data integration can be classified according to the (biological) question they try to answer.
In general all of them aim to provide a better understanding of the relationships between the ’omics types.
Often a single method is not enough and several methods are used on the same dataset.
This is specially relevant when a potentially relationship between omics is discovered.
For instance, checking that in a particular case or condition a given relationship is present, might require experimental confirmation.</p>
<p>Most of the times one (or several) of the following results are expected from integration methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification of the patients or samples</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the purposes of integration might be to use multiple sources of data to accurately describe how do samples or patients fit on a predefined possibles states.
The objective here might be to accurately describe whether a patient has one or other related disease of a possible subset of diseases or phenotype <span class="citation">[103]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the role of each individual omic in a biological system</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the question is which omic method is the best describing a disease.
This knowledge could prevent performing expensive tests and replace them by more affordable or easier technique that has enough predictive power or is sensitive enough and specific for the task.
An example of this is the search of markers on blood to identify links between different cell populations <span class="citation">[81, 104]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding a molecular signature</li>
</ul>
<p>A signature is usually a group of features that describe/are representative of a cell type, a process or a stage.
Identifying a subset of variables from the omics that are related is often a desired goal because it reduces the amount of variables allowing to perform experiments on the bench on just those that might be important.
In other fields, such as machine learning, selecting the important variables is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection" title="Wikipedia page of feature selection">feature selection</a>.
There are several methods that are used to do this <span class="citation">[100]</span>.
An example of this is when performing eQTL analysis, where a locus is related to a change in gene expression <span class="citation">[89–92]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A predictive model</li>
</ul>
<p>Predictive models usually require a very good understanding of the current and/or past relationships, as well as, a good feature selection procedure.
If a good model on previous data exists it might be used to predict future events.
Sometimes, models are only built to predict events without being able to accurately understand the underlying mechanism.
This kind of methods are used to improve treatment selection, diagnosis and prediction of prognosis <span class="citation">[105]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Impute values</li>
</ul>
<p>Some methods aim to accurately guess the values of missing data given some other information.
Missing values can happen for a variety of reasons from practical ones, like a sample not being available, to technical ones, such as laboratory mistake <span class="citation">[106]</span>.
However, this is often a intermediate step to other goals.</p>
<p>To complete these goals it is important to have enough statistical power to determine the significance of tests performed (if any) and to understand how complete are the data sources used on the integration <span class="citation">[107]</span>.
Having more statistical power helps identifying the relationships one seeks when using this methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="relationship-between-variables-and-samples" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.3</span> Relationship between variables and samples<a href="introduction.html#relationship-between-variables-and-samples" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Depending on the amount of variables and samples used in studies can be classified in two types.
Traditionally for each sample few variables are measured, for instance on a biopsy with RT-PCR only a few genes are measured, however with the new omics techniques (transcriptomics, metabolomics, methylomics, genomics), thousands of variables are measured for the same sample.
This has lead to the following situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>More variables than samples</li>
</ul>
<p>For a single sample of RNA around 50k genome identifiers (genes, long non coding RNAs, iRNA, pseudogenes,…) can be measured.
Which leads to the case where there are many more variables than samples.
Thus high-throughput data analysis typically falls into the category of <span class="math inline">\(p \gg n\)</span> problems ( big p, little n), where the number of genes or proteins, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, is considerably larger than the number of samples, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.
With such high number of variables the identification of the relevant variables is hard because variables will co-variate.
When many variables are tightly correlated, discovering which one is important using just numerical methods is challenging.
This is even more difficult when looking for causal relationships.</p>
<ul>
<li>More samples than variables</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the usual case when for instance, from a cohort of patients the temperature is measured along the stage of a disease: two variables, time and temperature for each sample.
If there are more than 2 patients, then the number of samples is greater than the number of variables studied.
This is described in the literature as <span class="math inline">\(n \gg p\)</span> (or big n, little p).
Nowadays this is less frequent on the bioscience world, and does not causes trouble analyzing it because the high number of samples allows to accurately estimate the dispersion of variables.</p>
<p>There are several methods available to estimate the number of samples required <span class="citation">[108]</span>.
Having just the enough samples for the desired statistical power, however, might not be enough in case some samples are not correctly processed.</p>
<p>In addition, variables might be separated on different blocks of variables.
These blocks might be just of the same source or from multiple methods.
Depending on the method this blocks might have special meaning: when all the data is joined in a single block it is known as superblock.</p>
</div>
<div id="relationship-between-samples" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.4</span> Relationship between samples<a href="introduction.html#relationship-between-samples" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Depending on the relationship between the samples, the questions answerable and the methods that work on them differ.</p>
<p>A sample can have multiple or one data source, for instance we could have RNA-seq and 16S data from the same sample.
In a study if all the samples have all the data from multiple data sources it is a complete case.
If some samples have data from some data sources but not from others the study is not a with a complete case.</p>
<p>Sometimes because the sample is not enough, or there are some technical or organizational problems a source of data for a sample (which is known as an incomplete case) might be lost.
This results in a new source of variation that has to be dealt with, which complicates the conclusion one can draw from the studies of these kind of data.</p>
<p>Even when all the cases of a patient are complete the samples can come from several sites of the same individual or with different combinations of variables, which makes it relevant to understand the relationships between the different samples.</p>
<p>There is no easy classification of this as each experiment might be designed differently.
In general, experiments are designed to be as consistent as possible but in face of adverse events that become a variation of the design the analysis complicates.
Either some data is imputed or some samples are omitted for the analysis.
This can happen with samples taken at different timepoints as patients for instance if they miss a follow up visit.</p>
<div id="time" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Time<a href="introduction.html#time" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>As mentioned above, time is one of the factors that sometimes cannot be controlled, despite having programmed visits every two weeks, for instance, some patients might come early or later due to multiple reasons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the objective of the study is precisely to analyze the relationships at different time, or to asses how the relationships change with time.
To discover causality between two variables the cause must precede the consequence, which highlights the importance of time.
Being aware of the time differences and time scales is crucial in most cases.</p>
<p>During <em>in vitro</em> experiments, conditions can be reproduced even if they are at different time.
However, when using patients material replicates can not usually be performed like <em>in vitro</em> experiments.
This makes it harder to study time-related change on patients.</p>
<p>Lastly, time between the collection of a fresh samples and its processing also influences the readings of the samples of the omics technology, specially RNA-seq <span class="citation">[109, 110]</span>.
Some genes are more influenced by time than others but as they are measured at the same time in all samples this might distort the data.
Keeping track of the time that it takes to process samples is also hard to due and requires a highly coordinated effort <span class="citation">[111]</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="relationship-between-variables" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.5">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.5</span> Relationship between variables<a href="introduction.html#relationship-between-variables" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Once data is collected, the next step is to understand the relationship between the variables present.
As mentioned earlier, some variables influence others which can affect the outcome in complex ways.
With many variables present in a dataset it is important to be aware of known relationships between variables.
Even in a simple dataset, like an RNA-seq dataset, it is important to be aware of the relationships between variables.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the lactose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operon">operon</a> it is known how some genes regulate each other <span class="citation">[112]</span>.
However, it is not know how other variables are related between them.
For instance, how does the increase in expression of a gene affects the growth of a microorganism?
Usually the relationships between variables are mediated by many factors or interactions.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of such interactions is when some variables correlate.
Their correlation can be used to reduce the number of variables being analyzed by ignoring the relationships between them and using the most representative variable (less widely correlated and with more variation).
This step is usually done by dimension reduction methods.
However, sometimes this is not desirable or feasible as the correlation does not explain the direction of the causality of the interaction between the variables (if there is any).</p>
<p>Network approaches relate the variables to each other <span class="citation">[113]</span>.
These approaches are fairly new and growing in popularity partly because they can address the direction of the interaction.</p>
<p>In partial correlations the effect of other variables on the two being under study are taken into account <span class="citation">[114]</span>.
They assumes a linear relationship between the co-occurring variables and those of interest.
However, it is computationally expensive when there are thousands of variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="input-data" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.6">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.6</span> Input data<a href="introduction.html#input-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>We have classified the studies according to the data they use (as seen <a href="introduction.html#data-origin">previously</a> ).
But, some methods to account for relationships of variables only work when a dataset is complete while other do not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data from the same samples:</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods do not handle well or at all missing data.
They need complete cases/data of the samples in order to be able to integrate the results.
These methods include Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA) <span class="citation">[115, 116]</span>, Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) <span class="citation">[117]</span>, Multi-Study Factor Analysis (MSFA) <span class="citation">[118]</span>, Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) <span class="citation">[119]</span> and STATegRa <span class="citation">[120]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data from different samples:</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods do not need data from the same sample.
They draw their conclusions generalizing from the data available.
Some of them handle missing data, while others do use the data at face value.
These method includes MetaPhlAn2 <span class="citation">[121]</span>, HUMAnN,<span class="citation">[122]</span> and LEfSe <span class="citation">[123]</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some methods are designed to integrate specific types of datasets, (usually because they make some assumptions that are only met on that kind of data).
For instance, HCG, 16S rRNA-seq, RNA-seq and metabolomics do not share the same data distribution, and are different between them.
Also even with the same data depending on the processing of the data they can have very different properties: OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) properties are not the same as ASV (amplicon sequence variants) when analyzing 16S rRNAseq data.</p>

<div id="mathematical-framework" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="1.3.1.7">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.7</span> Mathematical framework<a href="introduction.html#mathematical-framework" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Methods use different mathematical frameworks to process the data.
Here we briefly describe some common mathematical frameworks, some of which have previously appeared:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Networks</p>
<p>Networks methods were mentioned because they use and find information about the interaction of variables.
Multilayer networks, including the multiplex, Molti-C-DREAM <span class="citation">[124]</span>, Random Walk with Restart on Multiplex and Heterogeneous Biological Networks RWR-MH, Random walk with Restart on Multiplex RWR-M <span class="citation">[125]</span>.
Network embedding MultiVERSE are some of the methods using networks <span class="citation">[126]</span>.</p>
<p>Bayesian approaches are also quite frequent, these methods use the Bayes’ theorem to see the relationships between variables.
The Bayes’ theorem explains that the conditional probability of a variable is related to the prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event <span class="citation">[127]</span>.
Some methods that use these approaches are Reconstructing Integrative Molecular Bayesian Network (<a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/zhulab/?s=rimbanet">RIMBANET</a>) <span class="citation">[128]</span> and Bayesian Consensus Clustering (<a href="https://github.com/ttriche/bayesCC">BCC</a>) <span class="citation">[129]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Dimensional Reduction</p>
<p>These methods focus on finding just a few variables and summarizing them using a function that has some desired property such as the correlation between thre transformed variables is maximal while the components are orthogonal.s The selection of variables is usually done with L1 or Lasso Regression regularization technique or L2 also known as Ridge Regression.
L1-regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients which might leads to some coefficients becoming zero and the variable eliminated from the model.
On the other hand, L2-regularization does not result in elimination of coefficients or sparse models and can only be used when there is multicollinearity as it works well to avoid over-fitting.</p>
<p>Several tools use this approach, Momix <span class="citation">[130]</span>, regularized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) <span class="citation">[131]</span>, mixOmics <span class="citation">[132]</span> and STATegRa <span class="citation">[120]</span>.
Other methods use bayesian approches like the Bayesian Group Factor Analysis <span class="citation">[133]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Active module identification</p>
<p>Multi-omic objective genetic algorithm (scores based in two metrics; node score and density of interactions score).
An example of a method using this approach is Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to Find Active Modules in Multiplex Biological Networks (MOGAMUN) <span class="citation">[134]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually depending on the mathematical framework used, these methods return similar outputs.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1.8</span> Output results<a href="introduction.html#output-results" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>According to the output the integration methods can be classified in several groups:</p>
<p>For the network methods the following output is usually returned: Connections between the variables/nodes, a measure of how strong is the connection (or simply if there is a connection or not).</p>
<p>For dimensional reduction methods there are three possible outputs: Shared factor across the data, specific factors for each data or mixed factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared factors:</li>
</ul>
<p>Integration results in a vector of the samples in a lower dimensional space that is shared by all the data set used to integrate.
Such methods include iCluster, Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) <span class="citation">[119]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific factors:</li>
</ul>
<p>Integration results in several vectors of the samples in a lower dimensional space of each data set used to integrate.
Such methods include Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA) <span class="citation">[115, 116]</span>, Multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA) <span class="citation">[117]</span> and Multi-Study Factor Analysis (MSFA) <span class="citation">[118]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed factors:</li>

<p>Integration results in both shared and specific factors, to each dataset and common to all them.
Such methods include Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) <span class="citation">[135]</span> and integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization (<a href="https://github.com/yangzi4/iNMF">iNMF</a>) <span class="citation">[136]</span>.</p>

<p>How to interpret the results of applying the different methods is highly linked to understanding the method and its output.
On a correlation between two variables, the interpretation of the analysis is clear, if one variable increase, the other one too.
The implications of this correlation can be far reaching but the principles to understand them are simple.</p>
<p>However, on more complex methods the interpretation becomes less clear.
The interpretation of a canonical correlation analysis is much harder <span class="citation">[137]</span>.
Also on more complex methods the number of parameters required increases so the time and intellectual effort to understand the relationships between the parameters is also higher.</p>
<p>The interpretation also helps to discuss the results and relate it to other previously know information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individually:</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we study how each variable relates to another.
In the correlation analysis, the relationship between two variables under study.
Or if looking by patient: how do interpret that in these patient variable A and B is X and Y?</p>
<ul>
<li>Globally:</li>
</ul>
<p>In a principal component analysis for instance how do we interpret that some variables have the same loading?
What happens in a more complex method like canonical correlation analysis?</p>
<p>There are some articles about how to interpret those methods on real datasets <span class="citation">[138]</span>.
Others, to benchmark and to learn how to interpret propose analyzing a simulated dataset <span class="citation">[139, 140]</span>.
Which is used to compare the results of the integration with the dataset of interest and to compare different tools.
These datasets are created with some relationships that the tools are expected to find.</p>
<p>There exists several methods to create synthetic datasets like MOSim <span class="citation">[140]</span>, metaSPARSim <span class="citation">[141]</span>, CAMISIM <span class="citation">[142]</span>, ballgown <span class="citation">[143]</span>, polyester <span class="citation">[144]</span> and even edgeR <span class="citation">[145]</span>.
These methods are useful to compare different setup but they can miss some subtle not previously reported relations on real data.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Reviews<a href="introduction.html#reviews" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The comparison and review of methods independently from original authors have become a crucial step for selecting the right tool to apply a given dataset and research question <span class="citation">[130]</span>.</p>
<p>Some of these reviews focus on a specific type of data integration: metabolomics <span class="citation">[100]</span>, genomics <span class="citation">[11]</span>, microbiomics… Others focus on the disease and the challenges of each omics and the need of an integrative approach to provide better therapies <span class="citation">[107, 146, 147]</span>.
On this regard there are several efforts to integrate data on IBD but no comprehensive review to date is known to the author.
The most comprehensive article to date is a very recent review identifying problems and providing recommendations for future work <span class="citation">[148]</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4</span> Summary<a href="introduction.html#methods-integration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The field of integration is large and complex, with increasing interest over the last few years, specially in the psychology and omics fields.
As a methodology they are quite complex and diverse but there is a growing interest on them to help answer complex questions without using other complex tools like deep neuronal networks or other machine learning approaches (despite not being incompatible).</p>
<p>Methods to integrate have many characteristics, depending on the objectives and data that available.
Regardless of the method used, interpretation and reporting is usually the main challenge.</p>

<p>IBD is a gastrointestinal disease that includes two different diseases UC and CD.
It affects preferentially the lower intestinal tract causing lesions on the epithelial barrier.
Bacteria causes or use these lesions to further damage the patients.
But this interaction is also influenced by many other variables.</p>
<p>Data integration are methods to analyze datasets with data from multiple sources.
They include a variety of methods and there are methods for several purposes.
On IBD it has been used mostly sequencing data, disregarding the other variables known to be relevant.</p>
<p>Data integration on IBD has been underexplored despite being known that many factors interact on the pathogenesis and maintenance of the disease.</p>
