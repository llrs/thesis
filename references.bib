  abstract = {A variety of microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome) exist throughout the human body, with fundamental roles in human health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale framework to develop metagenomic protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput metagenomic data available to the scientific community. Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal RNA genes and over 3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far. In parallel, approximately 800 reference strains isolated from the human body have been sequenced. Collectively, these data represent the largest resource describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a framework for current and future studies.},

  abstract = {A situation where J blocks of variables X1, ..., XJ are observed on the same set of individuals is considered in this paper. A factor analysis approach is applied to blocks instead of variables. The latent variables (LV's) of each block should well explain their own block and at the same time the latent variables of same order should be as highly correlated as possible (positively or in absolute value). Two path models can be used in order to obtain the first order latent variables. The first one is related to confirmatory factor analysis: each LV related to one block is connected to all the LV's related to the other blocks. Then, PLS path modeling is used with mode A and centroid scheme. Use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The second model is related to hierarchical factor analysis. A causal model is built by relating the LV's of each block Xj to the LV of the super-block XJ+1 obtained by concatenation of X1, ..., XJ . Using PLS estimation of this model with mode A and pathweighting scheme gives an adequate solution for finding the first order latent variables. The use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The higher order latent variables are found by using the same algorithms on the deflated blocks. The first approach is compared with the MAXDIFF/MAXBET Van de Geer's algorithm (1984) and the second one with the ACOM algorithm (Chessel \& Hanafi, 1996). Sensory data describing Loire wines are used to illustrate these methods.},

It constitutes a general framework for many multi-block data analysis methods. It combines the power of multi-block data analysis methods (maximization of well identified criteria) and the flexibility of PLS path modeling (the researcher decides which blocks are connected and which are not). Searching for a fixed point of the stationary equations related to RGCCA, a new monotonically convergent algorithm, very similar to the PLS algorithm proposed by Herman Wold, is obtained. Finally, a practical example is discussed.},

The first approach has been developed around Karl J\"oreskog and the second one around Herman Wold under the name {"}PLS{"} (Partial Least Squares). Hwang and Takane have proposed a new component-based SEM method named Generalized Structured Component Analysis. Covariance-based SEM is usually used with an objective of model validation and needs a large sample. Component-based SEM is mainly used for score computation and can be carried out on very small samples. In this research, we will explore the use of ULS-SEM, PLS, GSCA, path analysis on block principal components and path analysis on block scales on customer satisfaction data. Our conclusion is that score computation and bootstrap validation are very insensitive to the choice of the method when the blocks are homogenous.},

  abstract = {Multi-omics approaches use a diversity of high-throughput technologies to profile the different molecular layers of living cells. Ideally, the integration of this information should result in comprehensive systems models of cellular physiology and regulation. However, most multi-omics projects still include a limited number of molecular assays and there have been very few multi-omic studies that evaluate dynamic processes such as cellular growth, development and adaptation. Hence, we lack formal analysis methods and comprehensive multi-omics datasets that can be leveraged to develop true multi-layered models for dynamic cellular systems. Here we present the STATegra multi-omics dataset that combines measurements from up to 10 different omics technologies applied to the same biological system, namely the well-studied mouse pre-B-cell differentiation. STATegra includes high-throughput measurements of chromatin structure, gene expression, proteomics and metabolomics, and it is complemented with single-cell data. To our knowledge, the STATegra collection is the most diverse multi-omics dataset describing a dynamic biological system.

  author = {Alissa Sherry and Robin K Henson},
  year = {1981},
  abstract = {The purpose of this article is to reduce potential statistical barriers and open doors to canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for applied behavioral scientists and personality researchers. CCA was selected for discussion, as it represents the highest level of the general linear model (GLM) and can be rather easily conceptualized as a method closely linked with the more widely under-stood Pearson r correlation coefficient. An understanding of CCA can lead to a more global ap-preciation of other univariate and multivariate methods in the GLM. We attempt to demonstrate CCA with basic language, using technical terminology only when necessary for understanding and use of the method. We present an entire example of a CCA analysis using SPSS (Version 11.0) with personality data. Many applied behavioral researchers are not aware that there is a general linear model (GLM) that governs most classical univariate (e.g., analysis of variance [ANOVA], regression) and multivariate (e.g., multivariate ANOVA [MANOVA], descriptive discriminant analysis) statistical methods. Ac-cordingly, many persons view these statistical methods as separate entities rather than conceptualizing their distinct similarities within the GLM. For example, because all classi-cal parametric analyses are part of the GLM, all of these anal-yses have certain things in common, including the facts that they (a) are ultimately correlational in nature, (b) yield r 2 -type effect sizes, (c) maximize shared variance between variables or between sets of variables, and (d) apply weights to observed variables to create synthetic (i.e., unobserved, la-tent) variables that often become the focus of the analysis (cf. Knowledge of the commonalities among statistical analy-ses is in stark contrast to the often compartmentalized statis-tical education that many graduate students and faculty have received. Unfortunately, this compartmentalization can lead to rigidity of thought concerning the methods as opposed to a fluid understanding of their purpose and utility, thereby hin-dering appropriate methodological applications in applied psychological research. Indeed, at least partially because of this educational paradigm, it not uncommon to see some graduate students physically shudder at the thought of endur-ing advanced methodological coursework. It should not be surprising, then, to find some graduate students taking great lengths to desperately avoid methodology curricula and, in extreme cases, seeking psychotherapy to reduce the systemic anxiety these courses seem to invoke! Statistics anxiety notwithstanding, the GLM provides a framework for understanding all classical analyses in terms of the simple Pearson r correlation coefficient. We demon-strate later, for example, the interpretation of a canonical cor-relation analysis (CCA), which has as its foundation the Pearson r correlation. The GLM can also be conceptualized as a hierarchal family, with CCA serving as the parent analy-sis. Contrary to the compartmentalized understanding of sta-tistical methods held by many researchers, CCA subsumes both univariate and multivariate methods as special cases},
