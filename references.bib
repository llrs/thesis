  abstract = {A variety of microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome) exist throughout the human body, with fundamental roles in human health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale framework to develop metagenomic protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput metagenomic data available to the scientific community. Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal RNA genes and over 3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far. In parallel, approximately 800 reference strains isolated from the human body have been sequenced. Collectively, these data represent the largest resource describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a framework for current and future studies.},

  abstract = {A situation where J blocks of variables X1, ..., XJ are observed on the same set of individuals is considered in this paper. A factor analysis approach is applied to blocks instead of variables. The latent variables (LV's) of each block should well explain their own block and at the same time the latent variables of same order should be as highly correlated as possible (positively or in absolute value). Two path models can be used in order to obtain the first order latent variables. The first one is related to confirmatory factor analysis: each LV related to one block is connected to all the LV's related to the other blocks. Then, PLS path modeling is used with mode A and centroid scheme. Use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The second model is related to hierarchical factor analysis. A causal model is built by relating the LV's of each block Xj to the LV of the super-block XJ+1 obtained by concatenation of X1, ..., XJ . Using PLS estimation of this model with mode A and pathweighting scheme gives an adequate solution for finding the first order latent variables. The use of mode B with centroid and factorial schemes is also discussed. The higher order latent variables are found by using the same algorithms on the deflated blocks. The first approach is compared with the MAXDIFF/MAXBET Van de Geer's algorithm (1984) and the second one with the ACOM algorithm (Chessel \& Hanafi, 1996). Sensory data describing Loire wines are used to illustrate these methods.},

  abstract = {A classical problem in statistics is to study relationships between several blocks of variables. The goal is to find variables of one block directly related to variables of other blocks. The Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA) is a very attractive framework to study such a kind of relationships between blocks. However, RGCCA captures linear relations between blocks and to assess nonlinear relations we propose a kernel extension of RGCCA.},

  abstract = {Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) is a generalization of regularized canonical correlation analysis to three or more sets of variables. It constitutes a general framework for many multi-block data analysis methods. It combines the power of multi-block data analysis methods (maximization of well identified criteria) and the flexibility of PLS path modeling (the researcher decides which blocks are connected and which are not). Searching for a fixed point of the stationary equations related to RGCCA, a new monotonically convergent algorithm, very similar to the PLS algorithm proposed by Herman Wold, is obtained. Finally, a practical example is discussed.},

  abstract = {Two complementary schools have come to the fore in the field of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM): covariance-based SEM and component-based SEM. The first approach has been developed around Karl J\"oreskog and the second one around Herman Wold under the name {"}PLS{"} (Partial Least Squares). Hwang and Takane have proposed a new component-based SEM method named Generalized Structured Component Analysis. Covariance-based SEM is usually used with an objective of model validation and needs a large sample. Component-based SEM is mainly used for score computation and can be carried out on very small samples. In this research, we will explore the use of ULS-SEM, PLS, GSCA, path analysis on block principal components and path analysis on block scales on customer satisfaction data. Our conclusion is that score computation and bootstrap validation are very insensitive to the choice of the method when the blocks are homogenous.},
