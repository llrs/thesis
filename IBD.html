<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Inflammatory bowel disease</h2>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes the chronic diseases Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) which are characterized by alternating periods of remission and clinical relapse that mainly affect the gastrointestinal tract. CD is a progressive reincident disease that can affect all the gastrointestinal tract but shows mostly on both terminal ilium and colon with a discontinous inflammation. The UC is a colonic reincident disease characterized by a continuous inflammation of the colon. Both of them have different risk factors, clinical, endoscopic an histological characteristics.</p>
<!-- Check with Elena Basolas Tesis p18-->
<p>On CD the disease has a granulome that can appear on any intestinal layer that consists on big multinucleous cells. while on UC we observe a different damage consisting in many neutrophil in the cript lumen.</p>
<p>In addition to the location(s) inflamed to distinguish between the diseases mosaic zones (patches of inflamed and non-inflamed areas) are more characteristic of CD.</p>
<p>Sometimes blood analysis are also used to if there are some factors altered such as leucocits, a high globular sedimentation speed, increas of protein C reactive and anemia. Also if there is an increase of calprotectine in fecal samples is indication of CD disease.</p>
<!-- Finish -->
<p>Around 4,2 million individuals suffer from IBD in Europe and North America combined. The dysregulation of the inflammatory response observed in IBD requires interplay between host genetic factors and the intestinal microbiome. Several studies support the concept that IBD arise from an exacerbate immune response against commensal gut microorganisms. Nonetheless, the disease could result from an imbalanced microbial composition leading to generalized or localized dysbiosis<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The role of the gut microbiome in IBD is an ongoing field of research. Several authors are currently studying the alterations reported in IBD of the intestinal microbiome. However, it is still unclear the cause-effect relation between dysbiosis and IBD. Partly due to the multiple variables that might contribute to the disease progression; for instance, age, diet, usage of antibiotic, tobacco, environment, and eventually socioeconomic status. This could be due to both the genetic predisposition and environmental factors; for instance, bacterial or viral infection, diet, usage of antibiotic, and eventually the socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>(see <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-human_microbiome_project_consortium_framework_2012">18</a>]</span> )</p>
<p>The relationship between host and microbiome has been proposed to play a fundamental role to maintain the disease. Little is known of the influence of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the expression of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<div id="disease-etiology" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Disease etiology</h3>
<p>As noted on the introduction, the origin of the disease is unknown. There are several articles that point out to a relationship between the immune system and the microbiome.</p>
<p>As seen the Crohn's disease and the ulcerative colitis are considered two different disease due to their differences despite their similarities.</p>
<p>Although so far we do not know what starts the disease there are differences on the disease when appears at different age. There is a rough classification between very early, early or adult on-set disease. The main differences are [ask Isa?] .</p>
</div>
<div id="crohns-disease" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Crohn's disease</h3>
<p>As previously introduced, Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by alternating periods of remission and clinical relapse it is frequently associated with extraintestinal manifestation and/or concomitant immuno-mediated diseases. Inflammation on the gastrointestinal tract is transmural and can affect from the mouth to the anus, but mainly it manifests on the ileum and colon.</p>
<div id="clinical-presentation" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.1</span> Clinical presentation</h4>
<p>The disease itself manifest an heterogeneous symptoms that can involve, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, malaise. Other co-occurring manifestations are arthritis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, skin disorders venous or arterial thromboembolism and/or pulmonary involvement. All these symptoms make it hard to provide a diagnosis by non-specialists and can lead to delays on correct diagnosis of the disease as there isn't a single gold standard test for its diagnosis.</p>
<!--Tesis Ana p21-->
<p>The detection of parasites or bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, would admit an infectious disease. The detection of fecal calprotectin, is a good marker of endocopic activity with sensitivity above 70% and specificity above 80% generally. Usually the diagnosis is performed with a colonoscopy, whether there is inflammation on the gastroinestinal tract on discontinuous regions then is Crohn's disease. This inflammation could also present as an ulceration and rectal sparing. Histological lesions also help to diagnose the patients.</p>
<!--Finish-->
<p>To address this difficulty the Montreal classification aims to classify patients according to their age of disease onset, standardized anatomical disease location an disease behaviour. This classification assumes that the location of Crohn's disease remains stable over time after diagnosis but behavioral phenotypes change with most patients progressing from an inflammatory phenotype to a stricturing or penetrating one.</p>
<p>There is to some extent a disassociated between patient's (clinic) well-being report and the colonoscopy observation. Often patients report feeling better but their gut is as inflamed as previously. This has lead to several scores and thresholds used on research and treatment of the patients.</p>
</div>
<div id="disease-course" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2.2</span> Disease course</h4>
<p>In the early stages of the disease the relapsing and remitting course is more frequent. Often relapses are accompanied by clinical symptoms, and very few have prolonged clinical remission. When there is clinical remission, as mentioned above there can still remain some other lesions and sublinical inflammation often persists. Often the damage caused by the disease evolves to fibrostenotic stricture or penetrating lesions (fistula and abscess).</p>
<p>Although Crohn's disease and colon disease are similar the drugs and treatments for each is different. The order of the treatment/drugs changes depending on the disease.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ulcerative-colitis" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Ulcerative colitis</h3>
<p>Around a third of the patients with ulcerative colitis suffer proctitis, followed by left colitis, when the affected area starts on the rectum and extends to the left colon, distal colitis, defined as disease limited to rectum and sigmoid colon, extensive colitis as involvement of at least the descending colon, and pancolitis, when the disease affects all the colon. The extension and severity of the disease does correlate with the clinical observation, where longer extension is a worse prognosis <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-etchevers2009">19</a>]</span>. Extensive colitis is also associated with extensive care <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-etchevers2009">19</a>]</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="clinical-care" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Clinical care</h3>
<p>The goal of treatment is not limited to clinical remission<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but rather to mucosal healing, which means the reconstitution of the structure and function of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Mucosal healing is a first step towards the healing of deeper layers of the inflamed bowel wall on the Crohn's disease.</p>
<p>Clinical remission is not enough to avoid relapse and the bowel may not be free of lesions, evolving to other phenotypes such as fibrostenotic stricture or penetrating lesions increasing the structural bowel damage.</p>
<p>Colectomy<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> is a surgery procedure done when there is colorectal cancer or the damage on the colon has been too big. That sometimes IBD patients have to endure.</p>
<p>Patients that undergo a colectomy need to have their bowel reconnected with a procedure called ileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgery. This often ends up in a pouchitis<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Which might extend to healthy areas.</p>
<p>Dysplasia<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> is often associated with crhonic IBD patients, which is considered a precendence before colorectal cancer develops <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-mark-christensen2018">20</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>Fistula<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> is often found on the phenetrating phenotype of IBD patients.</p>
<p>Herpes and citomegalovirus virus.</p>
<p>Imaging techniques</p>
<p>Many scores have been proposed for several purposes, from quality of life to disease severity or patient status. Among the scores most used are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mayo: A score designed to be simple to calculate at the bedside based on stool frequency, bleeding, mucosal apperance at endocopy and disease activity. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-schroeder1987">21</a>]</span></p></li>
<li><p>SES-CD: simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-daperno2004">22</a>]</span>. Score based on size of ulcers, ulcerate surface percentage, affected surface and presence of narrowings on the bowel.</p></li>
<li><p>IBDQ: A 32 questionnaire used to assess the quality of life grouped into four categories: bowel, systemic, social and emotional. <span class="citation">[<a href="#ref-irvine1999">23</a>]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other measured parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Weight</p></li>
<li><p>Calprotectin</p></li>
<li><p>PCR (Proteinc C reactive)</p></li>
<li><p>Hemoglobine</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="drugs-and-treaments" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4.1</span> Drugs and treaments</h4>
<p>The ones given on the hospital more or less on the order of administration, although this varies between patients and time according to recurrent meetings doctors have and current recomendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>anti-TNF<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span></li>
<li>Vedolizumab</li>
<li>Ustekinumab</li>
<li>Risankizumab</li>
<li>Tofacitinib</li>
<li>surgery</li>
<li>TRIM/HSCT</li>
<li>5-asa</li>
<li>corticoesteroids</li>
<li>Azathiprine/Mercaptopurine 6MCP</li>
<li>Methotrexate MTX</li>
<li>Tacrolimus FK</li>
<li>Cyclosporin A CyA</li>
<li>Infliximab</li>
<li>Adalimumab</li>
<li>Antibiotics</li>
</ul>
<p>All these drugs and procedures are available at the time of writing, and patients were taking one or more of those drugs as standard of care.</p>
<p>Often a reduction in dose results in losing the response to the drug. Thus, after an increase of the dose to the previous levels the patients not recover the initial response they had.</p>
<p>A separate procedure that is done on the Hospital is the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). This is a new procedure given only to the most extreme cases for which several publications have checked that it resets the immunological state of the patient.</p>
<p>Last there are several proposal of fecal microbiota transplantation, which are not done on the Hospital ClÃ­nic yet. But are proposed to reset or change the intestinal microbiome of the patients to help them on the disease. This has been doing experimentally on mice and mouse for some time and some experiments on patients resulted have been performed already.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Summary</h3>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex disease that impacts the health of many people in different ways.</p>
<p>Current clinical care in some cases is enough to have a sustained clinical and endoscopic remission but most often is not enough and relapse is expected. Several factors, such as becoming refractory to drugs, intermittent discourse of the disease, make the treatment complex.</p>
<p>The lack of knowledge of what are the factors of the ethiology and causes of the disease make those treatments and drugs to be addressed to block further inflammation and damage, but cannot prevent it and often they do not stop it completely.</p>
