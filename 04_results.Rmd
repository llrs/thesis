# Results

experDesign worked well and no batch effect were created when sequencing samples.
Unfortunately, a problem with the 16S of the cohort rendered that useless.

RGCCA with inteRmodel method identify better models than other methods (MCIA).

Model 2.2 is best on cohort X, Y, Z.

# Biological relevance of results

Transciptome is related to localizaion of the samples.

Microbiome is more related to the disease and other variables of the patients.

Time is an important variable when modelling the disease, if multiple timepoints are taken they should be taken into account to identify the state of the disease for each patient.

## Comparing different dataset

## Shared selected variables

BaseSet didn't work, it is computationally expensive to calculate the likelihood of 1500 variables, there are too many combinations and the numeric precision of said calculations must be considered carefully.
